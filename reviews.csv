1,136820275,2328760,"Good game, graphics do look better than FX3, and there are some new tables. Ray tracing is available on supported GPUs but I left it off.
HOWEVER, having to buy all the previous tables again sucks, I thought there was a discount for re-buying but the prices look the same as before?

I'll only buy the new tables, and play the old ones on FX3 unless they're given away free or really really cheap.

2,136820498,1364020,"What a great game with so much promise, I am in love with the movement and the 360 degree combat. Learning to traverse the maps and use positioning and movement is so unique and fun. The gun play is also great and I wouldn't change much, some balancing is needed which the devs have already noted. 

Tarkov ruined all FPS games for me and this is the first fps game I have enjoyed in years. 

A lot of people are not sold on the audio it certainly feels strange to start with but I soon grew to love it as we have all got so used to the overwhelming audio in most games now.

Spawns need a bit of work but this has also already been noted by the devs and the interaction and updates from the devs at launch has been really good and fills me with some confidence this game will only get better.

Other things to note are the UI could do with some work and region lock could do with being added. But the foundation for this game is really strong and unique if they can keep supporting it and polishing it, this will be Gem.

5,136820298,1364020,"Interesting gameplay, its quite fun. Though... most games influenced by China seem to go downhill quite quickly and thus I hope to be proven wrong here. I hope they can maintain a healthy playerbase, improve transparency on their plans going forward, and won't resort to awful monetization practices. The last thing I want to see is them tossing in an abundance of microtransactions into a paid game, and even worse, end up making the game free JUST to justify continue sale of cash grabby cosmetics born of laziness and lack of care to have a good game that isn't infested with trash like that.

It's very nice, but really early in its development.

This game as a whole is full of tiny details like that, which they threw in without needing to. It looks like a tiny game because of the pixel art, but there's a [b] lot [/b] in here.
There's a lot of emphasis on player choice, especially mechanically. The story is fairly linear as of Day 2, but even that has its fair share of decisions that I won't spoil.
The setpieces and UI are nice and smooth, and the band never seems to run out of bangers to play (with some charming lyrics set the rhythm, in text box form). 
But half the time, it'll just crash after an encounter. It's a mild inconvenience since it's remembered the end result each time, and I haven't lost any progress due to this bug. The polish is otherwise top notch.
Wholehearted recommendation, this is a game that feels tailored to me specifically. Think Kaiji and Your Turn To Die mixed together, into a creamy concoction of constant, simmered hype.

20,136818823,2329130,This is a pretty good game and I had a good time with it. I plan to have an in-depth review on my Youtube channel this week. Keep up the great work! :),1
21,136817733,2329130,"TLDR: Its good, it doesn't do anything to groundbreaking. 
I beat it in about 2.5 hours, its pretty linear but the level design is functional with some highlights and the art design is pretty strong overall. Scares are OK for the most part, the atmosphere in the first half is strong although there are a few lazy jump scares.
My only major criticism is that the killer AI could use some work in a certain scene to make it feel a bit more tense. Due to the length of said scene, the limitations of the AI become very evident - limiting the overall tension factor.
I would also have liked to see some explanation of the killer's backstory and motives as whilst he has a strong design, he seems very 2D. 
A final point is that the game seems to be set in England with many familiar sights including but not limited to the bins. My immersion was shattered however as there are American cop cars on the streets rather than our Battenburg Marking'd filth mobiles  - 0/10 please fix.",1

23,136818916,1922010,"Solid gun play. Extremely fun and useful Gadget/economy system. One of the best at launch titles I have player in VR for years. I look forward to them expanding this game and adding new and improved features. Worth the $30 but if you find this game on sale don't question a pick up of this title. 

Only downside is that at this time there is no party systems so grouping with friends can be annoying at times. You will have better luck just making a private server and waiting for it to populate.

Feedback to the Devs - You've gotten everything right, for sustainability on a VR platform you will have to push constant updates even if Minor. Try to focus on the optimization first as lag will turn people away from a VR title. Eventually adding a player/community map system will benefit you, even if it is a voted through process from your team. Until then I would try to add in more maps as 3 or 4 maps at launch will get stale fast. Besides that keep up the hard work! Love this game.",1

34,136821416,1649740,"Thoroughly enjoyed this game; its the first game I've been engaged enough with to try and beat in one sitting (it took two). Gorgeous pixel art, interesting lore/worldbuilding, solid combat, unique and challenging bosses. There are enough different weapons/abilities and enough variety of environments/enemies that I actually felt compelled to try different options, which doesn't always happen for me in these types of games.  I've seen a few negative reviews that dislike the feel of the combat, but to each their own, I suppose. Overall, if you're searching for a minimalist 2D indie Bloodborne, or something that feels a bit like a very challenging Link to the Past, Hunt the Night may be worth checking out.",1

36,136821781,1651560,"I've played The Settler's franchise for many years, I tested out the new ""The Settlers: New Allies"" game that recently came out before trying this game as well.

The game is an absolute masterpiece in the making.
Please keep up the incredible work, devs.
There isn't even combat in the game yet and i'd rather spend hours building in Fabledom, than play the atrocity that is ""New Allies"", which has combat. 
The graphics are beautiful yet simplistic, game play incredibly smooth, the Prince and Princess mechanic i find to be amazingly unique, you guys really did create something beautiful here. 

The amount of content already in the game as a ""early access"", is incredible and I'm very excited to see what future updates/changes will bring!!!! 

I highly recommend this game to everyone!!!

This game is a pristine, immaculate, Diamond among the rough pebbles, please give this game a try!!!",1

39,136821787,1183800,"Its been a few years since I lost a night of sleep because I turned a game on at 9pm only to turn it off at 9am, even then only because I had real world responsibilities. Game starts off pretty hard but once you get a few key level ups, you can start chewing through enemies with your cooldown based abilities. I am incredibly impressed with how unique each character is and how varied their individual playstyles are. This game is a rogue-lite technically but each (winning) run will take well over 10 hours, probably closer to the 15-20 hours for your first run.

I cannot stress enough just how FUN this game is and how much I've fallen in love with it. Its genuinely an improvement on the games that it gathered so much inspiration from. This game tries to do so much and succeeds on almost every point, you can clearly see the passion behind this title and the audience really does benefit from it. This is the easiest recommend that I have had in years.

Despite all my praise, there are three [i] small [/i] gripes I have with this game:
[*]  the XCOM Fog of War pod aggro system. If you move one tile too far you can pretty much be ambushed by enemies you're very much not ready for. Can slow the pace of the game significantly on certain maps.

[*]  no undo button for non-chance related actions. You overwatched someone and then realized 5 seconds later a much better use of their turn? Too bad, overwatch can't be de-activated even though it hasn't really taken effect yet.

[*]  there's an upgrade that gives you the ability to give an action to any character once per map ...except you can't use that ability on characters that have no remaining actions. For an ability that's once per map, it feels really bad to pre-emptively pop that once per map action on someone just in case they miss their 85% shot. Should have the option to provide that action to anyone, regardless of their current remaining actions.",1
40,136820949,1183800,"mostly mixed:

- the concept is brilliant, xcom with some very light darkest dungeon campfire mechanics
- replayability is extremely low
- total playtime is about 5h or so for a run
- game warns that it is _difficult_ but even on higher difficulty i found it to be quite trivial
- 2 or 3 classes are extremely overpowered, most others are not very useful
- it gets VERY repetitive very fast

for 10, 15 bucks, it's good value",1

It's also the exact same maps and exact same game as the non-vr title, so nothing new except... VR. 

I've played through the 4 first maps and everything was the same, the challenges, etc.

61,136823116,1941780,"[h1]Game's not bad by any means, of course it's currently an alpha[/h1]

[code]Wouldn't say it's a roguelike due to the fact you can respawn on death, timer ups difficulty of zombies, among other things. Personally, can be fun with friends. [/code]

Tutorial's bare bones but frankly it has its purpose made clear, figured it out after a while, weapons can be found in ? Point of interests while ! Are boss locations. Bosses and ??? Will respawn.

Currently two bosses in the game, Riot and Queen 'Zumbie' 

Each boss you kill unlocks a weapon of respective tier for future use at the start of a round, i.e starting off with a tier 2 gun instead of using literally nothing. 

Game needs polish, it's an alpha, bosses can range anywhere from 'Can cheese with a corner' to ""Moderately difficult if fought head on.'

[spoiler]The Riot zombie can be cheesed by kiting it after phase 1, it's got a maximum range for its shotgun attacks, so just kite out of range, Queen Zombie can literally be cheesed by hiding in the stairs and peeking out to take shots.[/spoiler]

Game overall isn't horrible, pretty alright for an alpha release.

Only downside i've really seen from my own experience and other reviews, melee can be a little underwhelming and zombies can be unrelenting, unless you kite through several buildings I've had a boss zombie literally follow me halfway across the map. Aggro is unlimited from what I can tell. 

[code]Honestly wait for more to come otherwise don't hold it too bad.[/code]

And I've played alot of survival games on PS5,Xbox, And PC.

Now lets get into the cool stuff that you will love alot right away.

1. Controller support off the getgo... able to be played on Steam Link... on my Phone.
2. Carts... Yes carry all your items with you and don't think your in The Forest... wait wrong game... either way we got 2 of them so far.
3. Ships... yes full on exploration using ships... when you get it... its very fun to just drive around.
4. The game's early hard mode, goes away once you get to know what your doing... the difficulty was hard sure... but it was good... later updates might need to add more difficult enemies on newer islands... but for now its fine.
5. Stone,Flint,Obisidian... plans for Copper,Iron... what? you want cool stuff. go get the resources... the wait is worth it when you finally get a obisidian spear and can kill all those annoying pesky uhh squirrls? waht are they again... to busy murdering these things.
6. Foundation base building similar to ARK,Forest, and alot of other games... at least its windows are interactable.
7. A Dock Piece... yes a Dock Buildable piece... why do games just not have any Prefabs nowadays? this prefab is one of my fav looking.
8. I Love the story.
9. I've never CTD Or Hard Crash, besides Lag Spikes here and there... game is running perfectly fine.
10. Im running out of ideas... i'll edit later and add more stuff.

The Bad.

1. FPS Drops here and there, nothing major... you won't notice it.... mostly when loading alot of stuff in... which you will be fine dealin with.
2. The Lack of more content... now this isn't a major thing... its just i want more. and its coming, so don't let that get you down.
3. The Walking/Movement... now it seems slow sure... but this was probably to slow the early game down... which is fine, but we need a faster movement later game.
4. Doesn't seem to be any Stone Building/Brick/Clay building, could be a future update.
5. Tools break fast... idk if its me... or i'm just using them to much.
6. Figuring out Hides... is a nightmare... and needs improved... abit more... the Jackel hide as far as i can tell does nothing... the only way to get hides is from Boar.
6. It rains to much... idk this just annoys me personally it constantly is rainning... but it is the tropics... i just wish it was less.
7. Custom settings... for resource respawns... world day/night cycle... monster amount counts... stuff like this is missing and should be a feature later on... for Custom Difficulty.
8. 2 Boats... at the time of writing this and playing it... I Was hoping more. then again still early access.
9. Mapping is kindof weird... since i can't auto map while walking? like i've seen this area... just map it already? do it in a more smaller reveal area... if you want it that way... but when the map says NOTHING SEEn... i'm confused.... since i remember the area... explorers would just remember the stuff... not map everything... most of the time... ish.
10. nothing really else... i can pull out of my head... game is fine, it just needs more updates.

68,137263342,2089500,"So far been enjoying this game immensely.

It has built a very charming and sweet world that is very easily to fall in love with. The art style is very pretty and feels magical, the soundtrack is incredible, 100% worth getting as well if you enjoy the style or genre for listening to even when not playing. 

The game play is familiar, but unique. I can see some people finding it a tad awkward or uncomfortable at first coming from other games with similar mechanics (slay the spire etc), however once it clicks (and it will) you will find it flows incredibly well for a slightly faster paced card battler. Learning to be knowledgeable with your deck and how to best use your hand within and being able to make that decision quickly is incredibly satisfying. If you are finding it a tad weird, just push through a little more until it clicks, I promise its worth it.

What am I talking about? First, bots either can't hit you at arm's length, or they kill you with a shotgun at a distance of hundreds of meters. Maybe I haven't learned how to play yet, but I would like to understand if this is a feature, or if it needs to be fixed. I'm also very tired of logistics. If you have more than three factories, then your head starts to hurt after about 40 minutes of the game, because you need to keep in mind where how much and what is missing. Otherwise, the gameplay is more than pleasant, and even such a complex logistics is quite interesting at first, but it gets very tiring over time.

And I bet I only scratched the surface on that one case. The way information is gathered and the ability to add pretty much any evidence you find to the board is super helpful.

I'm not big on pixel graphics games, however this holds up very well with some of the most immersive design and good use of lighting that even I can appreciate the art style.

The gameplay is where this really shines, incredibly deep detective simulation where everything can play a role in the crime scene: 
Is there fingerprints on that toothpaste?
What size shoes did the victim wear? Do they match up with those boot prints?
Where does their spouse work? Whats their working hours? Perhaps I should drop by.
Whats the last telephone call they sent/received? Maybe i'll trace it

9.5/10",1
81,137264968,986130,"Rough around the edges (hence the early access) but so damn fun. There's just no other game out there like this that lets you be an investigator in such a dynamic and free way. The game combines so many dynamic systems together to create a detailed playground of hundreds of citizens leaving paper trails for you to follow, every one of which you can dig deeper into by breaking into their home, or work, to learn more about them.

Murders happen dynamically while you play, meaning you can accidentally find yourself at the scene of the crime as it happens. Or not. However, the many ways that you can approach the discovery of the murderer is insane no matter when you arrive. 

I found myself at the scene of a crime yesterday that happened on the streets. After gathering information on the body I was able to instinctively look around the scene for a security camera. After a little breaking in I was able to view the footage during the time frame the murder happened, which lead me to a visual description of about 5 people. To narrow it down, I asked people around that area of the city if they seen anything, and I was on my path to solve the murder, and it worked.

85,137265084,2341410,"I love it when puzzle games have very simple mechanics but do a lot with it. Out of the gate this game tells you ""think before you move"" and it's right! if you go for a trial and error approach it can get frustrating, but if you actually stop and plan your moves, it's a very satisfying game. Music and art are well thought out and executed, there is a coherence between the two which is nice to see from a small indie title like this. Overall this game could be a little bit of a hidden gem, I hope more people find it!

If I could wish for an improvement it would be more easier levels in the beginning to smooth out the learning curve a little bit, to allow players some time to practice how to think in this game. Give a level or two to practice thinking with each mechanic before we have to learn a new one!",1

There are so many cool looking dragons in this

87,137266113,1234180,"i got this game because i saw it circulating on twitter and i thought the art style looked really neat.

what i like:
the game looks great, feels good to play with controller, i enjoy being able to toggle visual effects such as blur and chromatic abberation, the enemies are simple but memorable in their design, weirdly shaped guys. i particularly like how are all the vehicles are rendered; all the shadows when turning and stuff are gorgeous.

now..... onto what's making me unable to finish it.
often times i feel like enemies are too powerful, or there's too many. this isn't that bad with the green guys and their generators, because you can just walk ahead, get rid of those and get the darsanauts to safety - it isn't as easy, and not nearly as fun, to fend off the several spaceship-steering green guys, the bats or the diggers.
next, the decision to limit your jetpack use in level 17, where it's  a bit inconveniencing, and in 27, where i've stopped now. this just isn't fun for me, when being able to fly around for a while is already a thing you were able to do previously, as well as reusing it in level 27, where there is so much verticality you could explore alot faster with the regular jetpack.
one more thing i personally dislike is the way the cursor is bound to the camera and movement of the player when using mouse and keyboard (not the recommended controls, but still). adding to that, the crosshair is REALLY hard to see.

i started out really enjoying this game, it was laid back and pretty alright difficulty wise - even the little remarks the characters make about the game being hard but the player just needing to get better were silly and fun. but as it went on it just made me more and more frustrated. it's really a shame, because i can tell alot of love and effort went into moons of darsalon, and i really wanted to play it all the way through. despite all that, major respect for the solo developer crafting this game througout the years!! i hope other people have more fun with this than me.",1

The game has successfully brought a new mechanic to the tower defense world and attracted puzzle enthusiasts to its audience. I also liked that there are both rewards and penalties for digging, which balances the game well. Sometimes, the newly opened enemy spawn points challenge me, but they also made me think more strategically and step outside of my classic tower defense tactics. As a result, the game lasts longer, and it's a great idea. There are still some points that need to be balanced, for example, I don't feel satisfied enough as I kill enemies, but overall it's quite successful for the Prologue version.",1

But, sadly, in my experience thus far, I've reached a dead end on all fronts of investigation and this is where you start to notice how the communication with the AI is lackluster. There's so many things I'd do differently IRL, but I'm bound to the game's rules and I don't know how to proceed. Pretty much all AI say the same things like ""it's none of your business"" and ""I'm not gonna tell you that"".

All in all, great game, I hope I learn how to get through this and I hope devs fix this lack of tips when stuff like this happens. It's not like I got stuck right away like a noob. I got pretty far.

They MASSIVELY dropped the ball on the endings though. 
If steam had a good rating system that alone would make me drop this from a 9/10 to a 6/10.

At the end you need to chose from one of  5 categories without knowing whats in them without being able to go back after picking one and then you are presented with a bunch of random text that doesn't really correlate with the respective job.
Now that already sounds annoying but the best part about it is that you don't actually get to choose at all!
Every random text blurb has like 5 different jobs associated with it and which one you get is determined by EIGHTEEN different skills/numbers. 
Have too much of one skill? Tough luck you are locked out of that ending forever.

Going 100% without a guide would take easily hundreds of hours that's like asking a blind man to sort marbles by color you are just stumbling through the dark.

This completely ruined the game for me. 
I was ready to do a few runs for all the endings but with this system it would just be me micromanaging 18 numbers comparing it with the guide spreadsheet and spamming through the entire games dialogue (no skip function) just so I can get the ""Slightly worse knight than the other ending""-ending.

I have no idea why they went out of their way to make the ending system a black box full of knifes this is actively malicious in how bad it is.
PLEASE JUST GIVE ME A LIST OF ALL THE JOBS AVAILABLE

Because of how the game locks you out of endings if you are too good for them you need to basically do 58 playthroughs for every single ending.

Then I started going to the addresses and knocking on their doors until in the fourth apartment I found a person who had the matching eye color, I had to bribe him so he let me inside his home where I found his drivers licence which confirmed that the name and age matched so I arrested him and got my reward money.",1

143,137268676,986130,">Early Access Review as of 04/2023

Compared to other games with procedurally generated elements where pieces of the world fit together like a child's 12 piece jigsaw puzzle, Shadows of Doubt is a technical marvel. 

Despite performance hiccups when moving indoors/outdoors it manages to balance a ton of moving pieces at once like NPC information, their schedules, relationships all while you run across town, through buildings and up and down elevators without a single loading screen.

Gameplay wise it's very satisfying tying together threads and uncovering these randomly generated mysteries. There are commonalities however and while everyone has a unique and fun story to tell right now I think it'll be two months before they all begin to sound alike.

While you can follow many different interesting threads like tracing phone calls, finger print scanning, checking security tapes etc. 
All leads however boil down into breaking into a place which hasn't been balanced because of the random nature of it. And to break into a place it will only ever follow 3 paths: 1. Bribe your way in 2. Go in through the vents 3. Disable security and lockpick in, with your limited items and gadgets only helping to slightly even the odds but it isn't enough. 

The dialogue tree isn't versatile enough to feel natural. Speaking to NPCs feels like talking to Morrowind NPCs who have no quests attached to them. They can tell you who they are, who they knows, where places are but not anything of substance or relevance.

The combat system is incredibly janky and nonfunctional. You can only temporarily stun and render opponents asleep for 2 mins or surprise and cuff them from behind although this approach might bug the game with an unending 'Pursuit' of you.
Guns feature in the game but you cannot use them and supposedly they won't ever be able to be used because killing NPCs would break the procedurally generated elements. 

You will be discovered, you will die, you will save scum, you'll find out the place you spent hours trying to get into wasn't actually related to the case at all. 
Only in the tutorial mission will you ever be handed the closest thing the game has to a smoking gun. These cases are incredibly difficult.

Side missions trick you into thinking that a case to find a missing necklace is an easy beginner's case but instead you'll be handed only a fingerprint and an address book with 14+ people in it to sort through. 
A mission like this can take hours and end up being a total waste of money, effort and time.
Other missions simply say: Arrest this office worker, we don't know where he works, who he is, how old he is, what he looks like, no evidence, just go get him. 
Side missions seem to be a complete afterthought, not as fleshed out as the murder cases yet, not worth the time or effort as of now. 

Hours of progress can easily be lost and doomspiral until you're out of money, lockpick resources and wanted for more crimes than the criminal you're hunting.

The game desperately needs more player options for circumventing annoying stonewalls like uncooperative suspects and triple layered security systems for a janitor's broom closet. 

Alternate sneaking methods of entry like getting through windows, leveraging police warrants to get into suspect's homes, being able to use limited screwdrivers to disable security cameras from below.

Right now it only barely succeeds as a detective sim and you'll note other reviews of people who simply gave up on the snooping and now treat the game as a Hobo Looting Simulator. 
I'm hoping the devs can patch a few more features into this to fully deliver on the premise.

144,137268206,986130,"Good game even in its current state. It‚Äôs like a procedurally generated noir/private detective story that plays kinda like Deus Ex or Thief with a decent amount of BladeRunner‚Äòs bleak vibe. The graphics aren‚Äôt amazing but the post processing is used to good effect.

Interacting with the environment is really immersive. Like if you open a drawer you don‚Äôt get a pop up window to show you what‚Äôs in there, the draw itself opens up and whatever‚Äôs in the drawer is actually in the drawer.

Had heaps of fun solving the first ‚Äútutorial‚Äù murder, and one procedural one after that.
There are side jobs you can take, I need to take a photo of someone and all I know about them is they have green eyes, their partner‚Äôs first name (Ying), and their partner‚Äôs profession. So I gotta go visiting all the ‚ÄúY.‚Äùs in the phone book.
It gives you difficult tasks and you have to figure out how to achieve them using what‚Äôs available to you in game. It‚Äôs nice that it doesn‚Äôt help you out too much.

You can buy an apartment and furnish it which is kind of cool, I wasn‚Äôt really expecting that from this game but it‚Äôs a nice distraction from cases. Not sure if you can own multiple apartments at once. Dev please add being a landlord.

Only issue is maybe performance, it runs decently on my laptop at 1080p and mid-high settings but it‚Äôs a decent laptop. 40-60 fps with frames capped at 60. Even at 40 it‚Äôs very playable because it‚Äôs a fairly slow paced game most of the time.
Laptop specs:
RTX 3050 4GB
Ryzen7 6800H 
16GB DDR5 

I‚Äôm impressed it performs as decently as it does because of just how much stuff is being simulated. Like all 300 citizens have jobs and go out for meals and drinks and stuff. And while they‚Äôre doing that, every security camera is actually watching for people and taking photos of them, that you can break into the security computer and look at, and print them out to add to your cork board.

So yeah just be warned that it might not run on your busted-ass hoopty laptop from 2018 but it‚Äôs a fun and unique game",1

152,137270787,1608640,"""OXTO"" is an intense, adrenaline-fueled, twin-stick-shooter-roguelike with similar graphics and gameplay as ""Hotline Miami"", but with its own gorgeous style and the addition of bullet-time, dodgeroll and (a much needed) health bar.

The visuals are viscerally noir, the soundtrack slaps you in the face just right, the story and lore of the mysterious entity manifesting as the mansion and the Sisyphus-like task at hand (which is a meta-comment for the genre) is told well and with a grain of existential dread.

Unfortunately, the first area of the game can get old when you already did various runs and then it is very hard to die to the first boss, which seems a bit of a chore. Also some of the drinks (skills) seem superior to others, but these two complaints are just a minor setback.

Many of the flaws from this game comes from the lack of content, from leveling up you can literally pick every skill available in the level up selection. Monster, boss and meta progression are also very limited. When you start progressing towards the higher difficulty, the game is not very optimized and I've had a fair bit of frame drops mainly because my character was firing way too many shots per second and had way too many books shooting on screen as well.

The game isn't bad in any way shape or form but it just isn't quite there yet. Even at 5 bucks, you could find plenty of other survivor clones with much more content and better optimization, such as Brotato or Rogue: Genesia.",0

There's a ton of promise here, but the game is currently pretty unstable - i've been experiencing frequent crashes to the point i haven't actually been able to make much progress in a case. I've noticed some general performance hitches, but being on a 3090 they're not too noticable. 

There are also some pretty major blind spots in the game right now that force you to take a hardline extra-legal approach. You can't just *ask* to see the security footage, you need to bribe them for the codes or break in. You can't just *ask* for access to an apartment from say, a building manager or the cops, you have to break in. There doesn't appear to be any way to say, befriend citizens so they're more friendly toward you, willing to give you tips etc, staples of the detective genre. Obviously these would be fairly complex systems to implement, and the game is still in early access, but their absence is very loud.

This is probably just be a skill issue, but I found the case-board RAPIDLY got out of control with the amount of evidence I felt I needed to keep tracked. Just the stuff I found in the victims apartment from the introductory case managed to take up almost half the board - this might also be that I was gathering every possible piece of evidence from fingerprints to casings to the most recent phonecall.",1

First i want to get the negatives out of the way, [b] to the developers hopefully you read this!!!! [/b]

I suspect these are already getting worked on. But i would still like to state it, so if you decide to get the game you can know what to expect as of April 25, 2023. (WILL UPDATED when a dew updates release.) 

Performance: Needs to be improved, that said i haven't had too much of an issue, i have a i7 7700k and 1080ti and it runs quite smoothly at 1440p. However it does stutter sometimes. Load times can be a little long, but surprisingly not as bad as i thought they were going to be on a very large world.

AI: I would love to see the AI react to the environment and player in a more realistic manor. Just a quick example; If you shut off someones PC while their on it they will get upset at you. If you throw something at someone have a brawl but people whipping out pistols to cap you is a bit too common LOL. 

More Variety of Missions (although there is still a decent amount of missions for the game just releasing).

More Detailed information on people. Example, instead of just saying Height: ""Tall"" Maybe give a specific height for better immersion...

[b]POSITIVE:[/b]

[b]Procedural:[/b] This is the big one and will help with longevity of this game. Missions are procedural, maps, people. As far as i can tell you can literally go into EVERY building, every room. People actually live in those buildings, work, visit people. In that regard it feels like a living simulation. Not sure if everything is dynamic or if the investigation starts once you accept the mission however, murders seem to be dynamic. They can happen randomly. Which is awesome.

Detailed investigation: Find fingerprints, links to people, witnesses, read emails, watch CCTV footage and more to figure out who the suspect is. 
Since everything is procedural no two cities, cases, people are the same. 

Graphics: Really love the graphics, the lighting is quite spectacular IMO.

[b]This game has a long way to go for sure, but as long as the devs stick with it and keep working with the community to see what they would like this will shape up to easily be the best detective game on the market. 
Even in its current state, i'd say this is still one of the best detective games ever made.[/b]

[b] [u] I 100% RECOMMEND SUPPORTING THESE DEVS AND SHOWING THEM YOUR LOVE. If you want to play as a detective in a simulated world that doesn't hold your hand on how to solve mysteries this game is for you. Also in terms of the price of games now a days, it is an extremely fair price.[/b] [/u]

First Impressions
-----------

Put on a trenchcoat and solve [strike]conspiracies[/strike] murders.  This game has a heavy deus ex cyberpunk vibe while being set in a fictional 1979*.  There are no unusable doors here, every building in this small-but-tall city is fully explorable, filled with citizens going about their daily lives, including working, dining, robbing and murdering the other citizens.  NPCs actually have to interact with things to get them to work, which can aid in your investigation - you can sometimes access a terminal that has been carelessly left logged in (or a door unlocked) by the employees when they leave.  Alternatively, the NPCs are sometimes careless enough to leave the post-it-notes near the safe/pc or a spare key under the doormat.  Make connections between murderer and murdered with one of those woollen-strings conspiracy boards, included with heaps of colours for your convenience.  You also don't have to talk to them, NPCs can be identified via voice, ID, location in the phone book, credentials on their work/home PCs, or even via breaking into the phone controller in the basement and checking the call logs.

Storytime, based on the tutorial mission:
-----------

I had a note to go find Onni Jonnson slipped under my door.  After looking up onni in the yellow pages, I tracked their address down to 802/Rose building, just down the road from my apartment.  Investigating the apartment, no one was answering despite the TV being on.  I gained entry via a key found under the doormat and found poor Onni crumpled under the desk in their bedroom.  exploration of the apartment found multiple VHS tapes, cigars, matchbooks from every casino in the country and several sets of fingerprints belonging to Onni and an as yet unknown person (marked as B on the conspiracy board).  I also found that Onni worked as a manager at Goldbourne Technologies.  Being the tutorial, the cops decided to bust in but were slowed because I was smart enough to have locked the door behind me in case this happened.  After taking the John McLane exit (not the last I'd be doing in this investigation) I made my way to Goldbourne, however it was outside of working hours and the security was on.  Luckily for me, the security guard had buggered off for the night and left their terminal unlocked, so I was able to turn the security cameras off and move around in the office more easily.  And by 'off' I mean 'shoot everyone going up and down the stairs' so the air was quickly filled with bullets and unconscious NPCs before I could turn them off.  
After [strike]inspecting the victims' wallets for information and free cash[/strike] making sure they were ok, I decided to leave and come back a few minutes later.  I ended up again crawling through vents, and Onni's desk was nice enough to be out of line of sight of the cameras.  In his emails I found references to a Penny Tyus, who appeared to be the supplier of the original note, and Violet Diaz, who was an associate of Onni's and worked at an illegal store in a local basement. Having also looted the security guard's safe and found a loose diamond inside, I promptly fell down the elevator shaft (who opened all the doors on the way down?  definitely wasn't me) and woke up in hospital, short of my loot.  Again, this was after-hours so the staff were all off-site and I could rob the place for meds and cash.  
To find Violet, I went to the underground store mentioned in the emails.  I had a passphrase but I [strike]misclicked[/strike] decided to barge in anyway, and found a set of ballistic armour before having to hide in the toilet from staff.  This did not go as planned because the staff wanted to use the toilet, however I was able to escape with the help of a truncheon I had bought using everyone else's money.  I decided to go to her home after looking her up in the phonebook, and after breaking my leg crawling through vents I got into the apartment of violet.  It turned out her husband worked at city hall, however my first priority was finding a splint to heal with.  This was interrupted as one of the homeowners was in the bathroom and interrupted my escape, again the truncheon saved my life and I was able to handcuff one of the occupants.  Within the room, I was able to find the murder weapon, and after applying some wooden anasthetic to Violet I was able to get hold of her fingerprints and link her back to the scene of the crime, as well as leaving her momentoes of her and her partner's cuffed, unconscious bodies using their own polaroid camera.  

I took the pistol as a memento and put it in my safe, along with an augmentation booster and a VHS both from Onni's apartment.  [b]A job well done for the City of Darkness PD[/b]",1

It doesn't take long to get to that point where you maintain food supplies and defense year round. The ramping up of enemies is a good motivator to not just settle in and stay on the planet. One annoying point, every playthrough the female characters all seem to like each other romantically and hate the men, the men all seem to like each other and hate the women... it's just not realistic. I get that you feel compelled to be ""inclusive"" these days, but your gay ratio is way the F off and it feels forced. I am looking  forward to the introduction of new enemies, maybe intelligent ones with weapons? Maybe some more storyline with the alien tech? Other than that, as far as survival base-builder colony games go, this one is pretty good.",1

Resources (ore/scrap) has become very scarce when at this tech level that is your primary resource you need, which makes for tedious play. That being said, it's early access and has a lot of room to grow. There is also modding support in workshop and already several mods made. I see a lot of potential in the future.

217,130901855,1324130,"I was on the fence, then looked up what previous games the dev did. This helped push me off the fence.

Stranded has come across as a well polished and stable experience. I have yet to get any survivors off the planet and still figuring out things. Only recently, I found that you can prioritise a specific task by selecting a survivor and then right clicking on the task.

Could do with more upgrades to help crafting items faster, and perhaps an upper and lower limit for producing items (start production when below this limit, stop production when above this limit) which I would find really helpful with cooking.

It does miss an ability to prioritise clearing out shelves/containers before deconstructing. Deconstruction is red so cannot prioritise until its empty (clicking keep this shelf empty helps at times but its not a solution). My survivors just seem to ignore the shelves and deal with over handling tasks instead.

Sending survivors off on expeditions and finding seasonal clothing set sounds great until they just return with a single item of clothes like a top. Rewards from expeditions just do not feel like they justify the cost of fuel for the journey.

I would like a way for switch to also be powered by a day/night sensor. Seems it will act as an override to the sensor and power will just stay on as per configuration of the switch itself alone.",1

221,137288858,2281730,"Utter trash is all this is.

Its a mobile port to PC, so no surprises when it comes to graphical quality. However, the game is trying so hard to be COD Modern Warfare 2019 while getting almost NOTHING right. Maps are too small, meaning you consistently get shot while spawning in. Movement is so exploitable that people just jump EVERYWHERE with no speed loss or cool down. Guns have like little to no recoil making it boring to shoot. With how the gun sways, zoom in on ADS, and camera shake, this game will give you motion sickness.

Geez to be honest i just love it and i was really excited on waiting for the early access/release, was too excited to wait lol. 

I'm for sure really to see map expansions, troop expansions, new research, new vehicles, new spawn maps etc.

But I do understand the downside of it tho, but i completely understand that it has minor issues/bugs. It is expected as a just released early access.

First of all, the paint style retro graphics are very cute, the player iguana is extremely customizable and looks delightful. The NPCs and enemies have a quite varied visual and sound design. The music is also diverse and fits the setting. Overall, the presentation of this game is fantastic, I could not stop smiling, it is sincere and goofy in just the right way.

The gameplay is split between normal exploration and combat, boss fights and different short and specific combat and platforming challenges in special rooms. Boss fights can be quite challenging and the player has to learn the moveset of each boss, which gets more expansive and faster as the fight goes on. Normal enemies are a bit more simple, but you still need the right approach to defeat them without taking damage. The combat is good and deeper than I expected. The reward for exploration and combat are usually gems, which you spend on improving your damage and health, buying powerful consumables and paying for healing. An effective and simple gameplay loop that doesn't overstay it's welcome.

If you are looking at reviews for a new top down racer to join your library it's safe to say you'd be happy with this purchase. And at a reasonable price. 

As an early access title this is a quality starting point that is fun on it's own with the groundwork for some awesome future updates. 

Driving is satisfying to me. I'm sure tweaks are on the horizon after this review, but I like the feel when your tires bite down just right cornering and the real difference that weather and worn tires provide. 

A.i. drivers will race hard and make mistakes. I had a lot of fun with them. I did not try online just yet but heard / saw good things. 

Big fan of customization so I can make my own racing stories and we have a custom Championship mode along with modding support from day 1. 

While it isn't in game modding of the a.i. you can use text files to change names and attributes as well as paint new liveries. 

I'm happy with the start and look forward to future updates include career mode.

I have encountered several bugs in my first 2 hours of gameplay, like game saves not working, infinite loading, characters aren't doing what they're supposed to, etc. All of which I'm sure would be fixed in a future update (hopefully). 

I'd say put the game on wishlist for now, and once the game gets a few big updates, you can then buy it.",0

The graphics are also a surprise, I would have been happy with half of what it is.

296,137308314,986130,"So far the game is great, with some issues that need ironing out. The side jobs are a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll get enough information to actually make the job worth it. The actual murders also need some fine tuning for similar reasons, only having a fingerprint to go off of is rough, especially when nothing about the victim points to that person. Thankfully most murders aren't a one and done, so after a while you'll get a second crime scene, and hopefully the murderer will leave something more substantial behind, or get caught in the act and very helpfully give you their name and fingerprint, true story. NPCs being extremely unhelpful is also an issue, someone was murdered and none of their neighbors are willing to tell me if they saw anything strange. A lot of these I imagine are due to the random generation, and I imagine could be tweaked, and changed. Despite those issues, and the myriad of bugs, I've been having a blast. The little things like being able to buy an apartment and furnish it, as well as going to the local diner and having a drink after a long day of solving cases and relieving corporate offices of their valuables, just add to the immersion. This is already a hell of a game, and if things are properly fixed, and fine tuned, it may just become a masterpiece.",1

After you've stumbled your way through the tutorial case, subsequent cases are borderline impossible to solve due to bugs.

i want more people to see and buy this game, so i'm leaving a thumbs-up score despite the game having some flaws and shortcomings which i'll briefly describe.

it's fun and immersive, and the feeling of wandering the world gives you a sense of scale. the places and even the items feel like they have a history (read the tooltips!). the enemies feel absolutely brutal, but in a game about slowly acquiring more and more power this is a good thing - i want to see a room full of those skeleton archers that have killed me so many times, and then erase them all with a single spell after working hard to reach those heights. i want to be able to build influence with villagers and sway them into forming alliances and making policies that further my goals. but in the current build of the game, those heights and goals can't be realized yet.

the foundation of the game is buggy but strong. the things this game sets the stage for are incredible and exactly the sorts of things i love and yearn for in interactive media. but the content isn't there yet, the systems are unfinished and janky, and the whole world needs a lot of polish. there's a huge amount of love and hard work present here, and it's paid off by showing me the potential of this game. i believe in it, and i hope you can give it a chance too.",1

309,137308138,2383860,"Playing the original Octodad again was a big dose of nostalgia, not just for the game itself but for this early era of indie games in general. For such an old student game hooking on a silly premise, there's still a whole lot of charm to find here between the detailed environment, the charmingly simple storytelling (and crudely drawn cutscenes), and of course the purposefully frustrating controls. I was also surprised to see just how much of this game would later be referenced in Dadliest Catch, which was very fun to find out after having played it fairly recently.

Of course, it's far from perfect. Compared to Dadliest Catch, which heavily polished this weird control scheme to bring out its looseness, this game feels a whole lot jankier and stiffer. Its very brief length also means it doesn't get to explore its concept very much, especially when most of the objectives in the game feel almost like an extended tutorial. This is with the exception of the final segment, which is very frustratingly designed and pushes the janky physics beyond the point of fun.

But even with how dated it can feel, Octodad is still a fun and charming little physics game all these years later, and one that doesn't overstay its welcome. It's still surprisingly impressive for a 2010 student game, and it deserves appreciation for kickstarting not only the incredible Dadliest Catch but also the indie studio that made it.",1

I think my only nitpick is that sometimes the directions for certain things (items needed for tasks for example) are sometimes a bit vague and take a little head scratching to figure out; but honestly give it a couple of days and there will be enough guides online that that won't be a problem either.

The game has no autosave system and crashes frequently. I've reported bugs through the game and in discord but I'm not seeing much developer feedback.

If you do purchase this game, SAVE CONSTANTLY. There's nothing more defeating than losing an hour worth of progress just to have it crash when you're taking your final photograph of your target.

Besides that, performance is rough. On a 3060 Ti I get sub 60 frames. Until a couple of more patches (and in particular, the fix for the camera crash) I'd hold off.

Because once those issues are resolved this game has all of the foundation to be great.",0
349,137310532,986130,"Disclaimer: I spent 10+hours with the demo version earlier this year so this review isn't based purely on 90 minutes of play time.

The Good: First impressions in terms of atmosphere and player freedom are very promising. Procedurally generating a city block with this much granular detail is no mean feat. The fact that you can interact with every object and NPC is initially exciting and a bit overwhelming. The tutorial case throws you in at the deep end and you really DO feel like a detective who is painstakingly combing through the crime scene, generating leads, following clues, tracking suspects, sneaking into premises etc. So yeah, that first few hours is genuinely impressive as a glimpse of what an immersive detective sim could be. 

The Bad: The core game loop starts to feel repetitive very quickly. This is mainly due to the proc gen nature of all the cases apart from the tutorial. I really enjoy detective stories, whether they are novels, tv shows, movies, podcasts, but the thing that I'm drawn to is often the characters, setting and events surrounding the case as much as it is the nuts and bolts of the crimes themselves. If Sherlock Holmes solved the same crime in the same location using the same method every time then it would get pretty old pretty quick. Shadows of Doubt's main problem for me is that there's no compelling story surrounding any of the generated cases atm. It's just similar bare-bones scenarios with the same kinds of leads to follow each time. Personally, I think I'd much rather play a game that had just a handful of crafted, unique cases for me to solve (but still with the freedom to approach each one in my own way) rather than an infinite amount of procedural cases that feel just that.

I'm also not that keen on how systems like survival and combat are handled (although this may just come down to personal taste). Thirst, hunger, tiredness etc. feel tacked on and the shoddiness of the combat system makes it feel like the developers would rather you play the game without resorting to violence. It makes me wish that there was a mode of the game where I could play as a police detective rather than a PI so that I could just focus on solving crimes but not have to worry about the other aspects of the game (maybe with the option to break the rules and sneak into somewhere without a search warrant; rough up a suspect for evidence etc.).

I really want to love this game - it's the kind of thing I've been dreaming of playing for years and years - but I can't recommend it in the current state. I'm hopeful that the full release will address the main issues I have with it and look forward to playing the finished version.

352,137310138,986130,"Just finished my first case and thought Id share it. So I start the tutorial explore around my apartment until a mysterious message is slipped under the door. I go to the address where I find a victim dead on the floor. Upon doing a once over the apartment I find a mysterious set of fingerprints on the open safe and the couch near where the victim was. I check the call log on the phone. It gives me a phone number. The victim has a book next to the phone I go through it and find that the number matches a Violet Diaz. So naturally I've found a potential of from the last person the victim spoke to. had a few other leads but decided to check that one first. Upon arriving at her apartment a man opens the door appears to not want to answer questions about who violet is. I give up asking questions so I go downstairs to the management office where I find an unlocked computer, where I am able to confirm Violet Diaz does live in that apartment with Shen. I find building blueprints and decide to sneak in through the vents in the dead of the night. While they are sleeping I drop in from an overhead vent into their bedroom. Begin checking carefully around their bed to not wake them. I find a ticket infraction on the nightstand for Violet seems she had recently been charged with a violent crime. So we've got a prior to work with, So I leave the apartment and sit on the bench outside waiting for her in the morning to leave to ask questions. however at 11a the apartment door opens she rushes out. I get a brief chat confirming that she matches the violet diaz on file from the resident report. She doesnt answer questions so I trail her to a nearby apartment where she enters. I begin making notes on the apartment when I gunfire. I rush in see Violet shooting a man, I quickly arrest her. See she has an 8mm lazarus on her. weapon matches ballistics I found at the prior crime. I get her fingerprints and they match the mysterious prints I found in the victims apartment. Finally I ask had they seen the victim and they say at 1:15a which was with the window for the time of death of the victim. I reported my evidence at city hall and solved the case and saved another potential victim. I'd say not many other games would give me that kind of experiance so would rate it highly so far.",1
353,137310053,986130,"This game does something that I've always dreamed about, and it does it really well (at the time of writing, I've only played for two hours).

You get to play as a detective in a city where each case is different from the other. You are given absolute freedom on what to do; the scale is enormous, even though the city itself is not so big, but it is procedural generated, so every person has their own identity, routine, dialogues and so on, which means that every city will feel different. I don't really know why, but when you analyze a specific scene and see fingerprints from another person, it gives such a feeling of scale that no other detective game ever did.  

It makes you actually feel like a detective, which is very hard to do in a game. There are no pointers nor any objective markers. You find your own clues, add them to the detective board and find connections that may lead to some progress (or sometimes to a dead end!). It's such a cool feeling because the whole city, every building, shop, apartament is yours to explore. 

A lot of times you end up doing illegal things like breaking in to someones home, or going to restricted places. The stealth mechanics are very important, and I can tell you that they are indeed pretty good. The stealth itself is quite forgiving (in a good way). It made me remember dishonored stealth, which is always a good thing. 

The performance, unfortunately, is one of the major downsides. This is an early access game after all, so I didn't expect smooth fps, but the lack of customizable graphics settings is unfortunate. I have a rx5700 and I get around 40fps, with dips to mid 30s on 1440p. I rarely play games on lower fps than 60, but this game is so good I just couldn't stop playing because of some performance issues. The game itself runs smoothly, no stutters, only low fps. But don't make this a turnoff, the game is really worth buying. I'm sure this will get adressed pretty soon.

Some suggestions (if by any chance the developer is reading this):
One thing that could be added are some noise whenever someone's talking (like in some nintendo games) because sometimes I miss the subtitles since I didn't know someone was talking. There are some lighting issues that really affect visibility and, naturally, gameplay. Also, there are some bugs here and there, but again, it is an early access game.

The premise really hooked me and I was looking forward to see the game expand and become more refined. Sadly, the full release has left me disappointed. I like how the progression system works where you level up your portal to earn new abilities. However, the abilities themselves cross over between each class too heavily and so none of the 3 ruinarchs feel unique besides at the start. I also think the new win condition being checking off a list of different things to do to be incredibly disappointing and unfun. It forces you to branch out and do many different play styles instead of focusing on things you really enjoy, moreover, it seems it can lock you out of certain goals based on the upgrades you take. This checklist of goals should have been made into achievements like the side goals which provide chaos orbs upon completion. I preferred when the goal was to max out your portal for the win. The game leaves many of the mechanics to be very vague which leads to frustration especially when trying to figure out these goals. Also there are quite a few bugs, some of which are major. Anyways, really disappointed with the official release, hopefully things will change but seeing as this is 1.0 I do not have hope. What a shame.",0

It's one of those games that could've been a really good recommendation, but unfortunately as a whole package I can't recommend it. I played almost 2 hours and it seems based on other reviews game is less than 4 hours total which for $25 game is not a fair price.

Visuals and the world are really cool and beautiful, very simple but effective art style. Visually it reminds me of Ori and the Blind Forest a lot but in a simpler form. 

The combat for me was not really interesting and engaging, mainly you have to parry attacks to gain health and kill enemies, you have attack ability but it's secondary and very weak and simple (also attack was assigned to right mouse button which took a long time for me to get use to it), so it's mainly blocking and counter attacks. It might be good to update the UI for mouse buttons in game, it was really not clear which button to press in time!

Enemies are good but not that great, I encountered maybe 3-4 enemy types so far, but I really liked the boss fights, they were cool, fun and engaging. 
The world feels very empty, I felt I walked most of the time and nothing serious happened, And why there is Souls-like tag for this game? 

Also there is no dialogue in this game which can be a good or bad thing, I didn't mind much. Music was cool, except for one area that felt out of place in my opinion. 

I am still not sure should I finish this game or not but I think for this price and content I can't recommend to others.",0

362,137309880,2166060,"[quote] If you‚Äôve ever wanted to go against everything Dora the Adventurer and similar characters said just to spite them, this is your chance! [/quote]

If you were given the chance to get a house for free, but with the caveat of having to deal with cursed VHS tapes in the attic and potentially die in the process, would you do it? In this economy, 100% yeah I would! And so would the protagonist of Amanda the Adventurer! Well, kinda. She actually inherited the house, and despite an ominous message from her late aunt, she got curious and decided to check out the tapes herself. It‚Äôs as they say: curiosity killed the cat! Or the human, in this case.

[b]Amanda the Adventurer is a horror/puzzle game[/b] that takes place mostly in the inherited house‚Äôs attic. Contrary to what you may believe from the title, you don‚Äôt actually play as Amanda, but rather, as a person named Riley. The story is honestly very intriguing. You basically inherit the house, with an apology about the tapes in the attic, deciding to instantly watch them, because why not. What does the protagonist see, you ask? Well, I‚Äôll let the devs explain that themselves, as per their steam store page:

‚ÄúWhile the episode appears charming and simple on the surface, an uneasiness starts to settle in as Riley realizes that Amanda and Wooly, her sheep friend, seem to be communicating directly through the television set. (...) It‚Äôs almost as if Amanda needs something, and Riley becomes fascinated with finding out what that something may be.‚Äù Honestly, I could share more, but I think [b]you‚Äôre better off experiencing the story yourself. It‚Äôs nothing special, but for me quite a lot of the fun came from trying to figure out exactly what was happening[/b] - especially as the game has around 6 possible endings. But what exactly will you be doing to get to these endings?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967355390

[b]The gameplay is somewhat divided in two halves.[/b] You get to walk around in the in-game real world attic, with realistic-ish graphics, and in the other half, you get to watch and interact with Amanda and Wooly in their tapes. The gameplay perfectly alternates these halves by hiding clues within the tapes that you can then use to solve the real world puzzles, and if you‚Äôre paying attention, even find secrets! And trust me, [b]there are lots of secrets to find.[/b] So basically, you get a tape, put it in the VCR, finish watching it, turn around and solve a puzzle to get the next tape. It‚Äôs quite straightforward‚Ä¶ but again, only for the first ending. If you want to see the whole story, you‚Äôll have to think outside the box!

[b]Each half of the gameplay is pretty fun. The tapes were the highlight for me, though. In those, you get to watch Amanda and Wooly‚Äôs wonderful dynamic.[/b] The writing is great, and mirrors that of an early 2000‚Äôs era children‚Äôs cartoon - think Dora the adventurer, for example. As such, Amanda is always talking to us, and asking us simple questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite pie?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere do you think we keep the sugar?‚Äù with quite obviously wrong options to choose from such as ‚Äúthe sink‚Äù, alongside the correct option. [b]Here‚Äôs the kicker though: these questions get messed up, and it does not take long. Not only that, but you can freely choose to just give her the wrong answers, which pisses her off because she knows you‚Äôre playing her.[/b] I mean, who could be that dumb, right? Her reactions to that are sometimes funny‚Ä¶ and often scary. Especially if you‚Äôre the shy sheep Wooly. I would go as far as to say most of the horror aspect in this game comes from the tapes.

[b]As for the attic, well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs mostly there for you to solve puzzles and find secrets.[/b] Like I said, after every tape, you have a new main puzzle to solve to uncover the next tape. And let me tell you: [b]said puzzles are pretty fun![/b] You will be using quite a bit of your brain to get through some of them, especially if you want to get all the endings. Thankfully, the devs did a good job of giving very subtle hints in the right direction‚Ä¶ but again, those need you to really pay attention to things, especially what is being said on the tapes. And even then, a couple of puzzles might still elude you, but no shame in looking up the answers if push comes to shove. And I‚Äôm totally not just saying this because I had to look up answers, alright? Some of these endings are also tied to the aforementioned secrets, so you‚Äôll have a lot of content to work through.

But how exactly DO we get to these endings? How do we see the full picture? Simple: via replaying the game‚Ä¶ kinda.[b] You see, the game is short.[/b] Like, pretty short. You can get to the first ending within, say, 30 or so minutes depending on how good you are with puzzles. [b]However, that‚Äôs pretty much just the beginning.[/b] Once you get one ending, you can just press continue, and you‚Äôre thrown right back in the start of the story. You may think this is going to get tedious fast, but honestly? It didn‚Äôt for me. [b]The game is really well designed to allow you to take shortcuts, per say.[/b] One example would be the fact that you can skip tape sequences you‚Äôve already watched. Another would be that if you find a code, so long as you write it down, nothing is stopping you from using it as soon as you start and sort of sequence break. And who knows? Maybe some secrets REQUIRE sequence breaking‚Ä¶

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967355297

[b]In terms of the presentation, the game has quite a bit going for it.[/b] The soundtrack is fitting, but what I really enjoyed was the artstyle. There was a really nice contrast between the more realistic visuals of the attic and the ‚ÄúClassic, 90‚Äôs-style CGI that recalls a simpler era of animation‚Äù presented within the tapes and in the cursor. They honestly, actually nailed that style. [b]And the characters, Amanda and Wooly, are also VERY expressive[/b], which was a pretty pleasant surprise! Overall, seeing how much care went into the presentation of this game was awesome, really.

[b]On the more technical side of things, the game is unfortunately a bit glitchy.[/b] Nothing game breaking for me though, although I did see one or two reports of that in the steam discussions. It also should be noted that the devs are tracking the bugs and I have no doubt we will get patches soon. I had a couple of glitches that froze the tape I was watching and had me restart the game and lose like, a minute or two of progress, but my favorite glitch was actually with the options menu. As I was changing monitors and resolutions, all my graphics options turned into ‚Äúon‚Äù, and that way they remain to this moment despite reinstalling the game multiple times. My options menu actually looks quite funny now, but as much as I appreciate that my resolution is turned on, it‚Äôd be nice to, you know, actually be able to change it as well. While some glitches did escape the devs, they also seem to have taken measures against others. If you toss an item out of bounds, for example, it just respawns.

[b]Honestly, this isn‚Äôt a super long game: 2 to 4 hours, maybe, depending on how good you are at puzzles, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a negative trait.[/b] It‚Äôs a perfect bite-sized horror-themed puzzler, which I really enjoyed - although not very scary. Or maybe I‚Äôm resilient. Who knows. But I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs still scary enough that if you dislike horror games, you probably won‚Äôt like this either. And the best part? [b]Clearly a lot of love was put into this project, which is always a delight to see![/b] If you do pick the game up, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

392,137311923,986130,"I'm writing this review a day or two after launch and I have to say, there is some really cool stuff at play here. The mechanics at work behind collecting evidence and piecing together a puzzle feel very rewarding to toy with, and there's already a substantial amount of content to dive into, which is no doubt a gift from the game's procedural generation of murders / less-than-legal side jobs. I'm having a lot of fun solving murders and breaking into homes and businesses and installing cybernetic implants that make me taller and prettier... That being said, there are a LOT of bugs that have disrupted my playthrough.

Realistically, when considering all of the elements at work it's impressive how smoothly the game runs most of the time, but there's still an immersion breaking level of bugs at most levels of the gameplay (graphical, narrative generation, combat, AI pathing, etc.) Even still, it's a blast running around among the chaos.

I will say that having to reload a save because a job just didn't generate something it needed to was a pretty big bummer. And it does suck when you pick up a job because of the reward posted, only to find out that you don't have the resources available to complete it based on the information they give you.

All in all though, the main gameplay loop of homicide investigation - side job - side job - homicide investigation is still a lot of fun, ESPECIALLY considering how this game was released literally a day or two ago. I would recommend buying it if you're willing to support the developer early and you really like the premise / genres at play. If you don't want to drop $20 right away that's fine too but definitely wishlist + follow this because if the developer continues to patch and add content then this could become a runaway cult classic and I'm glad to be here at the beginning of something so innovative and cool.

I am editing the review down here because I completely forgot to mention that there's also a basebuilding mechanic to have fun with. I was completely surprised to find out you can actually buy apartments in the randomly generated city you create and customize them to your liking. I won't go into too much more detail about the game but I feel the need to impress upon anyone reading this that this game has a little bit of something to scratch all of the right parts of my brain.",1

However, be aware. 
1) Game Crashes randomly so save often (I lost about two hours of work lol)

3) Ugly hands (let my have black leather gloves. please)
4) Can't equip the weapons you find. It's probably just in the spirit of the game to be some batman like dude- but sometimes those criminals could use a bullet or two.
5) Can't move bodies/handcuffed people.

The Sim part of this game is one of the better I have every played. Finding the solutions is rather rewarding. 

Smaller Items to be Fixed 
- UI just stop workings from times to times.(Map Zooming just stop workings for some reason.) 
- placing apt. items can lead to the game freaking and throwing the player or item off the map
-- a lot of the apt items need to be flipped on Z access and the player can't do with out throwing it and hoping. 
- procedural mapping making needs a lil more testing coverage. (vent breaking floor. no lighting in some places, holes in the floor b2 that leads to player falling off map.)

395,137311588,909320,I like to play as the lich ruinarch. I could spread disease with the biolab to kill villagers and then raise them as skeletons.,1
396,137312155,1701520,"Stay away from this game. Horrible pacing, only able to quick travel with potions that are rare. A metroidvania map that 4x bigger than Sotn, good luck.  Good luck with no hints, guides or anything telling you where to go.",0
397,137312075,1701520,"Some very noticeable problem of the game at current stage: 

1) Fast travel. Who TF thought it's a good idea to require consumables which you CAN'T buy, and is even rarer than upgrade materials, armors, weapons etc. I beat more bosses than the amount of consumables I hold. So you basically can't fast travel because every time you want to go somewhere else you need to have at least 2 consumables, 1 for going there, 1 for coming back. I already cleared around 6-7 maps and I just don't see free fast travel unlocked. So whoever is playing the game, likely in their first 10 hours will have no fast travel ability. 

2) The problem with fast travel further aggravate the issue with checkpoint placement. The amount of bone fire is pathetic. To put hollow knight comparison, just imagine the entire crystal peak area has 2 benches total.  This basically how the checkpoints are placed in this game. Now with the fact you can't fast travel... I don't understand why anyone play tested the game would think this is a good idea.

3) The downward kick movement, the control says stick down + A button, but when you actually play it, simultaneously hold your stick down and press A doesn't work. Stick down needs to happen first. Again, why?  

4) Resources early game. With my progress now I am sufficient with healing & resources, but the first maybe 5-6 hours? You will only have ONE healing. Yes, you will be clearing 3-4 big regions with only 1 heal available, beating bosses with one 1 heal. And the fact that you can't fast travel, and the fact that there are only like 2 checkpoints for one entire region...

5) Merchants are mostly useless. I don't understand, devs placed so many npcs as merchants, but they are mostly useless. They don't sell upgrade materials, they don't sell fast travel consumables, some merchants will have 1-2 legit useful items but that's it. Blacksmith sells weapons that are worth that the ones you can acquire in game, the cooking girl is only useful once, after you bought all her meals she is useless. I've encountered 4-5 merchants so far, and they just feel useless. Unlike hollow knight, you can buy pins and charms and notch, blacksmith does your upgrade, but in this game, these stuff you need to find by exploring, and you can upgrade weapon in the menu yourself. Just feel like defeats the purpose of having these NPCs.

6) Weapon imbalance. Usually I go for greatswords, but as far as I can tell, it's so much worse than scythe/whip/dual swords. The problem with greatswords is you can't interrupt enemies. Just can't. And it's slow. The time you do a single attack dex weapons already did at least 2, so dex weapon actually deals more damage. And scythe/whip wins the war with long reach, especially whip has special jump attack which is a f***ing AOE that clears out the flying enemies with ease. Not to mention bosses's attack interval is smaller than greatsword's attack speed, using greatsword in boss battles is basically suicide. Weapon class needs to be balanced.

7) Charms. 8 hours in the game I collected total of 3 charms. Judging by the charm slots there should be around 30 charms if not more. The resource placement again is weird. I understand devs don't want players to be OP, but not giving anything in early game is not the way to go.

8) enemy placement. This is the problem with collision and enemy AI. So you have no invincibility when dash (at least I haven't got it yet), meaning collision damage. BUT, once an enemy spots you, they will STAY at the platform edge. See the problem here? You just can't jump to that platform without taking damage unless you somehow figure out a way to kill them, normal enemies are fine, but often you will have ranged enemies throwing firebombs at the platform edge, meaning you can't kill them/jump on the platform without tanking the damage. If i-frame is too much, just don't let enemies glued on the edge. I don't recall hollow knight has this problem ever, enemies will no occupy player's landing point forever.

I actually like the game, but these problems are very frustrating especially fast travel. Everything else is just minor frustration which can be dealt with, but fast travel mechanism is a major issue here.",0

[b] Toned down and distilled gameplay mechanics in exchange for more character and dialogue makes this a more story driven experience! [/b]

TLDR in case you don't want to watch the video:

1.  The comparison to Stardew Valley is definbitely warranted; but there are some unique mechanics in this game that stand out on its own.

2. The ‚Äòcontribution‚Äô and ‚Äòideas‚Äô mechanics actually make the gameplay slightly simpler as compared to Stardew Valley; but in exchange, it makes it a lot more story driven.

3. This encourages the player to focus more on completing tasks and story elements for the other characters, as well as explore and experience the world in order to progress.

It‚Äôs hard to play the farming mechanics on its own without actually moving the story along, and as such, it is less of a ‚Äòopen‚Äô world than some players might like - but if you enjoy a good story, and some interesting characters, then this game will be perfect for you!",1

The premise really hooked me and I was looking forward to see the game expand and become more refined. Sadly, the full release has left me disappointed. I like how the progression system works where you level up your portal to earn new abilities. However, the abilities themselves cross over between each class too heavily and so none of the 3 ruinarchs feel unique besides at the start. I also think the new win condition being checking off a list of different things to do to be incredibly disappointing and unfun. It forces you to branch out and do many different play styles instead of focusing on things you really enjoy, moreover, it seems it can lock you out of certain goals based on the upgrades you take. This checklist of goals should have been made into achievements like the side goals which provide chaos orbs upon completion. I preferred when the goal was to max out your portal for the win. The game leaves many of the mechanics to be very vague which leads to frustration especially when trying to figure out these goals. Also there are quite a few bugs, some of which are major. Anyways, really disappointed with the official release, hopefully things will change but seeing as this is 1.0 I do not have hope. What a shame.",0

It's one of those games that could've been a really good recommendation, but unfortunately as a whole package I can't recommend it. I played almost 2 hours and it seems based on other reviews game is less than 4 hours total which for $25 game is not a fair price.

Visuals and the world are really cool and beautiful, very simple but effective art style. Visually it reminds me of Ori and the Blind Forest a lot but in a simpler form. 

The combat for me was not really interesting and engaging, mainly you have to parry attacks to gain health and kill enemies, you have attack ability but it's secondary and very weak and simple (also attack was assigned to right mouse button which took a long time for me to get use to it), so it's mainly blocking and counter attacks. It might be good to update the UI for mouse buttons in game, it was really not clear which button to press in time!

Enemies are good but not that great, I encountered maybe 3-4 enemy types so far, but I really liked the boss fights, they were cool, fun and engaging. 
The world feels very empty, I felt I walked most of the time and nothing serious happened, And why there is Souls-like tag for this game? 

Also there is no dialogue in this game which can be a good or bad thing, I didn't mind much. Music was cool, except for one area that felt out of place in my opinion. 

I am still not sure should I finish this game or not but I think for this price and content I can't recommend to others.",0

436,137309880,2166060,"[quote] If you‚Äôve ever wanted to go against everything Dora the Adventurer and similar characters said just to spite them, this is your chance! [/quote]

If you were given the chance to get a house for free, but with the caveat of having to deal with cursed VHS tapes in the attic and potentially die in the process, would you do it? In this economy, 100% yeah I would! And so would the protagonist of Amanda the Adventurer! Well, kinda. She actually inherited the house, and despite an ominous message from her late aunt, she got curious and decided to check out the tapes herself. It‚Äôs as they say: curiosity killed the cat! Or the human, in this case.

[b]Amanda the Adventurer is a horror/puzzle game[/b] that takes place mostly in the inherited house‚Äôs attic. Contrary to what you may believe from the title, you don‚Äôt actually play as Amanda, but rather, as a person named Riley. The story is honestly very intriguing. You basically inherit the house, with an apology about the tapes in the attic, deciding to instantly watch them, because why not. What does the protagonist see, you ask? Well, I‚Äôll let the devs explain that themselves, as per their steam store page:

‚ÄúWhile the episode appears charming and simple on the surface, an uneasiness starts to settle in as Riley realizes that Amanda and Wooly, her sheep friend, seem to be communicating directly through the television set. (...) It‚Äôs almost as if Amanda needs something, and Riley becomes fascinated with finding out what that something may be.‚Äù Honestly, I could share more, but I think [b]you‚Äôre better off experiencing the story yourself. It‚Äôs nothing special, but for me quite a lot of the fun came from trying to figure out exactly what was happening[/b] - especially as the game has around 6 possible endings. But what exactly will you be doing to get to these endings?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967355390

[b]The gameplay is somewhat divided in two halves.[/b] You get to walk around in the in-game real world attic, with realistic-ish graphics, and in the other half, you get to watch and interact with Amanda and Wooly in their tapes. The gameplay perfectly alternates these halves by hiding clues within the tapes that you can then use to solve the real world puzzles, and if you‚Äôre paying attention, even find secrets! And trust me, [b]there are lots of secrets to find.[/b] So basically, you get a tape, put it in the VCR, finish watching it, turn around and solve a puzzle to get the next tape. It‚Äôs quite straightforward‚Ä¶ but again, only for the first ending. If you want to see the whole story, you‚Äôll have to think outside the box!

[b]Each half of the gameplay is pretty fun. The tapes were the highlight for me, though. In those, you get to watch Amanda and Wooly‚Äôs wonderful dynamic.[/b] The writing is great, and mirrors that of an early 2000‚Äôs era children‚Äôs cartoon - think Dora the adventurer, for example. As such, Amanda is always talking to us, and asking us simple questions like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite pie?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhere do you think we keep the sugar?‚Äù with quite obviously wrong options to choose from such as ‚Äúthe sink‚Äù, alongside the correct option. [b]Here‚Äôs the kicker though: these questions get messed up, and it does not take long. Not only that, but you can freely choose to just give her the wrong answers, which pisses her off because she knows you‚Äôre playing her.[/b] I mean, who could be that dumb, right? Her reactions to that are sometimes funny‚Ä¶ and often scary. Especially if you‚Äôre the shy sheep Wooly. I would go as far as to say most of the horror aspect in this game comes from the tapes.

[b]As for the attic, well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs mostly there for you to solve puzzles and find secrets.[/b] Like I said, after every tape, you have a new main puzzle to solve to uncover the next tape. And let me tell you: [b]said puzzles are pretty fun![/b] You will be using quite a bit of your brain to get through some of them, especially if you want to get all the endings. Thankfully, the devs did a good job of giving very subtle hints in the right direction‚Ä¶ but again, those need you to really pay attention to things, especially what is being said on the tapes. And even then, a couple of puzzles might still elude you, but no shame in looking up the answers if push comes to shove. And I‚Äôm totally not just saying this because I had to look up answers, alright? Some of these endings are also tied to the aforementioned secrets, so you‚Äôll have a lot of content to work through.

But how exactly DO we get to these endings? How do we see the full picture? Simple: via replaying the game‚Ä¶ kinda.[b] You see, the game is short.[/b] Like, pretty short. You can get to the first ending within, say, 30 or so minutes depending on how good you are with puzzles. [b]However, that‚Äôs pretty much just the beginning.[/b] Once you get one ending, you can just press continue, and you‚Äôre thrown right back in the start of the story. You may think this is going to get tedious fast, but honestly? It didn‚Äôt for me. [b]The game is really well designed to allow you to take shortcuts, per say.[/b] One example would be the fact that you can skip tape sequences you‚Äôve already watched. Another would be that if you find a code, so long as you write it down, nothing is stopping you from using it as soon as you start and sort of sequence break. And who knows? Maybe some secrets REQUIRE sequence breaking‚Ä¶

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967355297

[b]In terms of the presentation, the game has quite a bit going for it.[/b] The soundtrack is fitting, but what I really enjoyed was the artstyle. There was a really nice contrast between the more realistic visuals of the attic and the ‚ÄúClassic, 90‚Äôs-style CGI that recalls a simpler era of animation‚Äù presented within the tapes and in the cursor. They honestly, actually nailed that style. [b]And the characters, Amanda and Wooly, are also VERY expressive[/b], which was a pretty pleasant surprise! Overall, seeing how much care went into the presentation of this game was awesome, really.

[b]On the more technical side of things, the game is unfortunately a bit glitchy.[/b] Nothing game breaking for me though, although I did see one or two reports of that in the steam discussions. It also should be noted that the devs are tracking the bugs and I have no doubt we will get patches soon. I had a couple of glitches that froze the tape I was watching and had me restart the game and lose like, a minute or two of progress, but my favorite glitch was actually with the options menu. As I was changing monitors and resolutions, all my graphics options turned into ‚Äúon‚Äù, and that way they remain to this moment despite reinstalling the game multiple times. My options menu actually looks quite funny now, but as much as I appreciate that my resolution is turned on, it‚Äôd be nice to, you know, actually be able to change it as well. While some glitches did escape the devs, they also seem to have taken measures against others. If you toss an item out of bounds, for example, it just respawns.

[b]Honestly, this isn‚Äôt a super long game: 2 to 4 hours, maybe, depending on how good you are at puzzles, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a negative trait.[/b] It‚Äôs a perfect bite-sized horror-themed puzzler, which I really enjoyed - although not very scary. Or maybe I‚Äôm resilient. Who knows. But I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs still scary enough that if you dislike horror games, you probably won‚Äôt like this either. And the best part? [b]Clearly a lot of love was put into this project, which is always a delight to see![/b] If you do pick the game up, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

461,137311923,986130,"I'm writing this review a day or two after launch and I have to say, there is some really cool stuff at play here. The mechanics at work behind collecting evidence and piecing together a puzzle feel very rewarding to toy with, and there's already a substantial amount of content to dive into, which is no doubt a gift from the game's procedural generation of murders / less-than-legal side jobs. I'm having a lot of fun solving murders and breaking into homes and businesses and installing cybernetic implants that make me taller and prettier... That being said, there are a LOT of bugs that have disrupted my playthrough.

Realistically, when considering all of the elements at work it's impressive how smoothly the game runs most of the time, but there's still an immersion breaking level of bugs at most levels of the gameplay (graphical, narrative generation, combat, AI pathing, etc.) Even still, it's a blast running around among the chaos.

I will say that having to reload a save because a job just didn't generate something it needed to was a pretty big bummer. And it does suck when you pick up a job because of the reward posted, only to find out that you don't have the resources available to complete it based on the information they give you.

All in all though, the main gameplay loop of homicide investigation - side job - side job - homicide investigation is still a lot of fun, ESPECIALLY considering how this game was released literally a day or two ago. I would recommend buying it if you're willing to support the developer early and you really like the premise / genres at play. If you don't want to drop $20 right away that's fine too but definitely wishlist + follow this because if the developer continues to patch and add content then this could become a runaway cult classic and I'm glad to be here at the beginning of something so innovative and cool.

I am editing the review down here because I completely forgot to mention that there's also a basebuilding mechanic to have fun with. I was completely surprised to find out you can actually buy apartments in the randomly generated city you create and customize them to your liking. I won't go into too much more detail about the game but I feel the need to impress upon anyone reading this that this game has a little bit of something to scratch all of the right parts of my brain.",1

464,137312075,1701520,"Some very noticeable problem of the game at current stage: 

1) Fast travel. Who TF thought it's a good idea to require consumables which you CAN'T buy, and is even rarer than upgrade materials, armors, weapons etc. I beat more bosses than the amount of consumables I hold. So you basically can't fast travel because every time you want to go somewhere else you need to have at least 2 consumables, 1 for going there, 1 for coming back. I already cleared around 6-7 maps and I just don't see free fast travel unlocked. So whoever is playing the game, likely in their first 10 hours will have no fast travel ability. 

2) The problem with fast travel further aggravate the issue with checkpoint placement. The amount of bone fire is pathetic. To put hollow knight comparison, just imagine the entire crystal peak area has 2 benches total.  This basically how the checkpoints are placed in this game. Now with the fact you can't fast travel... I don't understand why anyone play tested the game would think this is a good idea.

3) The downward kick movement, the control says stick down + A button, but when you actually play it, simultaneously hold your stick down and press A doesn't work. Stick down needs to happen first. Again, why?  

4) Resources early game. With my progress now I am sufficient with healing & resources, but the first maybe 5-6 hours? You will only have ONE healing. Yes, you will be clearing 3-4 big regions with only 1 heal available, beating bosses with one 1 heal. And the fact that you can't fast travel, and the fact that there are only like 2 checkpoints for one entire region...

5) Merchants are mostly useless. I don't understand, devs placed so many npcs as merchants, but they are mostly useless. They don't sell upgrade materials, they don't sell fast travel consumables, some merchants will have 1-2 legit useful items but that's it. Blacksmith sells weapons that are worth that the ones you can acquire in game, the cooking girl is only useful once, after you bought all her meals she is useless. I've encountered 4-5 merchants so far, and they just feel useless. Unlike hollow knight, you can buy pins and charms and notch, blacksmith does your upgrade, but in this game, these stuff you need to find by exploring, and you can upgrade weapon in the menu yourself. Just feel like defeats the purpose of having these NPCs.

6) Weapon imbalance. Usually I go for greatswords, but as far as I can tell, it's so much worse than scythe/whip/dual swords. The problem with greatswords is you can't interrupt enemies. Just can't. And it's slow. The time you do a single attack dex weapons already did at least 2, so dex weapon actually deals more damage. And scythe/whip wins the war with long reach, especially whip has special jump attack which is a f***ing AOE that clears out the flying enemies with ease. Not to mention bosses's attack interval is smaller than greatsword's attack speed, using greatsword in boss battles is basically suicide. Weapon class needs to be balanced.

7) Charms. 8 hours in the game I collected total of 3 charms. Judging by the charm slots there should be around 30 charms if not more. The resource placement again is weird. I understand devs don't want players to be OP, but not giving anything in early game is not the way to go.

8) enemy placement. This is the problem with collision and enemy AI. So you have no invincibility when dash (at least I haven't got it yet), meaning collision damage. BUT, once an enemy spots you, they will STAY at the platform edge. See the problem here? You just can't jump to that platform without taking damage unless you somehow figure out a way to kill them, normal enemies are fine, but often you will have ranged enemies throwing firebombs at the platform edge, meaning you can't kill them/jump on the platform without tanking the damage. If i-frame is too much, just don't let enemies glued on the edge. I don't recall hollow knight has this problem ever, enemies will no occupy player's landing point forever.

I actually like the game, but these problems are very frustrating especially fast travel. Everything else is just minor frustration which can be dealt with, but fast travel mechanism is a major issue here.",0

TLDR in case you don't want to watch the video:

1.  The comparison to Stardew Valley is definbitely warranted; but there are some unique mechanics in this game that stand out on its own.

2. The ‚Äòcontribution‚Äô and ‚Äòideas‚Äô mechanics actually make the gameplay slightly simpler as compared to Stardew Valley; but in exchange, it makes it a lot more story driven.

3. This encourages the player to focus more on completing tasks and story elements for the other characters, as well as explore and experience the world in order to progress.

It‚Äôs hard to play the farming mechanics on its own without actually moving the story along, and as such, it is less of a ‚Äòopen‚Äô world than some players might like - but if you enjoy a good story, and some interesting characters, then this game will be perfect for you!",1

The guidance system is extremely poor, leaving players clueless about what to do and how to do it.

This isn't a bad game, but the big selling point is the graphics. Aside from that it is a poor mans version of Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld when it comes to gameplay and in particular fun emergent gameplay.

There is definitely a core of a good game that with time and developer imagination could blossom into something a lot more interesting and unpredictable.

There are a lot of basic QOL things missing, in particular being able to manage priorities for individual tasks like in Rimworld, i.e. if I set up a build fence order and a build house order, the people will randomly do whatever they feel like, I can't say ""DO THIS NOW!"" when there is an attack wave coming in and building the fence is crucial.

496,137314670,2166060,"Developed by MANGLEDmaw Games and published by ‚Äé@DreadXPGames  , Amanda is a unique gaming experience that you won't find anywhere else. It combines elements of 2000's TV series with an escape room horror genre to create a terrifying and immersive game that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
I was fortunate enough to receive a key from the amazing folks at ‚Äé@DreadXPGames , who generously provided me with the opportunity to review this game on my YouTube channel. I can honestly say that I was blown away by the level of detail and care that went into creating this game. From the intricate puzzles to the spine-tingling sound design, Amanda is a masterclass in horror game design.
One of the standout features of Amanda is the sheer number of secrets and hidden Easter eggs that are scattered throughout the game. I found myself going back multiple times just to explore and discover everything that this game had to offer. Some secrets are so well-hidden that you might never find them all, which adds an extra layer of replayability to an already fantastic game.
Despite playing the game extensively, I didn't encounter any major bugs or issues. The gameplay was smooth and seamless, which is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the development team.
Overall, I would highly recommend Amanda to anyone who loves horror games or is looking for a new and exciting gaming experience. It's an incredible game from a talented new development team, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.

You cannot fight (maybe it's good for people who want true peace? xD) and everything in the game feels the same as others of the same type. The current prize is really high.

The save system is not of my liking (you can only save while sleeping, but if you sleep you go to the next day). The time feels like too fast, so Imagine having your farm at FULL, it will be really crazy to do all in that short of time!

This is just my opinion, maybe if the prize was low or it's on sale I will buy the game for less than 10‚Ç¨.

514,137316274,2102320,"It is a cute game, but the ""living"" aspect is more of an annoyance than anything.  It doesn't change the layout at all, and therefore doesn't really function to randomize the experience. As a concept it's okay, but needs a lot of work. The moving and emerging blocks are not very creative, and are basically tiny loading screens -- aka just things that make you wait.

Hit boxes of both enemy attacks and even just the terrain are not great.  You can bypass a number of areas by dashing over wider gaps than intended. There are combat bugs as well where if you don't wait for the full animation of your spell to play out, and use another skill too quickly you won't get the buff/attack out and just lose it.  And then have to wait for it to come off CD again.

I enjoyed playing, but there are only 3 dungeons, and no difficulty toggle. It was very easy, and only got easier as you collected more equipment. I can just auto attack without even using skills and never die or be in any danger.

Weight system was pointless and should be removed out right.  Hunger system was also pointless and should be removed. It was just an annoyance and provided no benefit to anything. It didn't add urgency.  The hunger system is basically this:  Every 3-4 minutes you open your inventory and use 1 item.  Simplified, but this is the entire thing.

All in all, if you want to grind this, you can. I put almost 5 hours into the game though, and don't really feel like there's any need to go farther in its current state.

I find it hard to recommend at its current price with the content available. The full version with a price tag basically has the same overall content experience as the demo.  You can keep grinding the first dungeon in the demo and getting better gear etc.  And this is essentially what you get with the full version, except 2 more dungeons and maybe the loot pool is wider.  But I played the demo for 2 hours or so as well, and can tell you that I didn't get any additional satisfaction from the full version that I got from the demo.",0
515,137315789,2102320,"It's a tentative conditional recommend at the moment as it only came out to early access a day ago at time of writing

There's a good and decently fun foundation of a game but a lot of refining and additional content is still needed.
Currently there are only 3 dungeons and only having died once it took me less than 5 hours to complete the game. Probably would take even less for anyone more skilled/familiar with arpg style dungeon crawlers.
The dungeons pretty much all look the same right now with very slight colour changes and the enemy variety is low as there is not really much space to put enemies in with just 3 dungeons. Variety in general is lacking. All weapons i encountered effectively function the same so there's only one flavour of combat at the moment. Combat is a little bit clunky. Telegraphed enemy attacks don't seem to be always accurate and you still get hit even when you think you are out of the area and clear of the animation. The dodge roll reliant combat seems to clash with the living maze dungeon design as very often you either roll to fall off or the enemy aoe is bigger and faster than you can get out of in the narrow paths of the maze. Once beat the last dungeon you learn that you can keep playing endlessly and the enemies will increase in difficulty with each clear. At the moment i have 0 motivation to do that as i feel i've already experienced everything the game has to offer. 

Even though all of the above sounds negative i had fun  playing the game there's just little to nothing to go back for after just a short time playing. If you're ok with that, go for it. Otherwise i'd definitely suggest waiting for content updates.

With a sandbox game so deeply focused on procedural generation, there are bound to be bugs - both of the annoying and the fun variety - but they generally don't break the game outright and can be worked around.

[b]hoping forest[/b] is a typical tile-rearranging puzzler, what [b]frogger[/b] would be like if you had to create the path instead of jumping around in traffic like a lunatic with a death wish.

[b]60 levels[/b] in 4 zones, somewhat branching progression and an [b]optional 7-level tutorial[/b]. not a fan of the way level select is presented, 15 levels (one zone) could easily fit on a single screen without all the scrolling, 7 tutorial levels even more so. and [b]the first screen with zone selection should be merged with the stats screen[/b] to show what's been done without clicking each. no on-screen level numbers, but they appear briefly when the level starts and in the pause menu, good enough. level select should be accessible from said menu and the level result screen too. as is, [b]menu navigation is a chore[/b].

the goal is to make a path for the frog to reach the exit, ideally grabbing all 3 flies on the way. a [b]mandatory move limit[/b] is in place, the frog can only take so many steps (hops or jumps, surely) on a level, so instead of using every tile, you gotta optimize. not necessarily a bad thing, but [b]current path length should be shown to avoid all the counting[/b].

[b]the store page says there are 2 solutions for every level[/b], but all it means is there's a 'quick path' that most likely skips flies by utilizing as few tiles as possible. so basically [b]there's a proper solution and a beyond trivial one wasting time[/b] if you're going for perfection, as they're obviously exclusive. hardly something worth mentioning in the marketing material. what's more, [b]stats are bugged[/b], level select awards don't always match the stats screen and apparently achievements are based on the latter, so those are bugged too.

there are [b]4 medals to get on each level[/b], on top of the quick path award. excessive. one for passing the level, 3 more for each fly. it would make a lot more sense if the blue one was for completion and bronze, silver and gold for the flies, or 3 awards total (completion, quick, all flies), but it doesn't work like that. and I also run into some [b]buggy behavior or inconsistency[/b] here. sometimes not passing on the first try and pressing 'try again' on the result screen didn't give all medals if my second attempt was perfect, so a full level reset was necessary. I took the restart option in the pause menu as soft-reset (it's not), so I had to go back to the menu, click play, select zone, then select the level again. did I mention menu navigation is a chore?

[b]controls are mouse-based without hotkeys and horrible.[/b] no unnecessary camera controls, but have to drag tiles to switch them, so - listen! - hold the left mouse button to pick a tile up, don't let go, move the cursor around until you're over the tile you want to switch it with, and now you can release. left-clicking a tile simply rotates it, right click does nothing. normally, right click and/or the wheel would rotate and 2 clicks switch. what the fuck happened there? I also had the occasional issue with tiles, sometimes they wouldn't get picked up or rotated.

green tiles are versatile, can be moved and rotated, brown ones are fixed, only rotatable. [b]cars are a thing[/b], they move turn by turn (there's a counter for that at least), just like the frog, gotta make sure kermit doesn't end up under them. [b]no other mechanics, only levels getting bigger[/b], which rarely means an increase in quality, only busywork.

once the path is made, click start to see how the frog does. can't pause after (not great), but movement speed is decent and [b]failing (or passing) doesn't reset the level[/b], you can make necessary tweaks and try again. however, this [b]soft-reset takes way too long[/b] with extra cutesy animations, a fail screen with all the unearned medals appearing one by one and unnecessary screen transitions.

okay presentation, except [b]every level looks the same[/b], no difference between zones. [b]music doesn't play in the menu and settings are lacking[/b], good soundtrack otherwise. there are separate volume settings and a couple of languages, that's it, [b]no windowed mode[/b] and none of it is available while playing. alt+enter creates a resizable window, and while it goes back to full screen resolution properly, window size resets if you switch back, so it's far from acceptable. also, [b]unskippable credits[/b]. once the button is clicked, you can either wait until it's over or press alt+f4. again, what the fuck? and there's missing punctuation everywhere.

it's a [b]very basic, unintuitive, tedious and buggy[/b] game, didn't even finish it. [b]anne boonchuy wouldn't approve, and oh my frog, the price is crazy too[/b], 9 eur is way too much for something like this. if things change, I'll edit the review, might even flip it if everything gets sorted out, but even then I'd suggest waiting for a 50% discount at least. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/2301210]busway islands[/url], for instance, came out at the same time, doesn't have frogs and it's also on the simpler side, but it's the same thing done better for a third of the price. there are other alternatives as well.",0

554,137316833,1669980,"In comparing this game to Princess Maker 2, some things are better and some worse, but overall it is an inferior offering.  Still, that doesn't mean it wasn't a pretty fun game.  I enjoyed a first play through and then a new game+ for the ""perfect"" ending.

The attribute system is greatly simplified as compared to PM2.  In some ways this is a good thing, as it is much easier to understand for new players.  In some ways this is the worst thing about the game.  It's so easy to just max everything (especially on new game+) that you can make one character to tour all the top tier endings without much trouble.  This tanks the replay value as compared to PM2, where getting any top tier ending involved careful planning to meet the requirements and ""just maxing everything"" was a pipe dream.

The romance system was the same old thing used since original Harvest Moon, you can chat and gift people once a day, so no points for originality.  However it fits well in this sort of game, and it's as functional as it has always been.

One point where is surpasses PM2 is the UI.  PM2 was mostly just a set of lists that let you pick what you wanted to do.  In Volcano Princess, different actions are performed in different places in and around town, so you actually have to travel to those different places to do things instead of just selecting them from a list.  It gives the game a bit more personality and makes the game world feel larger.

Overall, while it is an inferior game, it's still a fun game.  I enjoyed my two plays, and while it doesn't have any replay value beyond that, it still made for a good 24 hours of game time.  I recommend it to fans of the genre.",1

560,137318231,1867520,"Seeing a lot of negative reviews for such bad reasons made me need to post a positive one as its a nice game, cute and some casual fun.
There are some valid complaints of course, mostly quality of life stuff but nothing truly off putting and the visuals aren‚Äôt going to be to everyone's taste but still I feel it deserves a better standing than what it‚Äôs currently rated.
I‚Äôm still fairly early into the game but have had a lot of fun so far so will comment on a few things.

The controls are a bit clunky at times but easy to get used to. I played with a controller (character creation aside its fine) but I can see the need for the option to change key binds although I don‚Äôt find them that awkward at all.

Tutorial wise it takes you through the basics pretty well, most people complaining here just didn‚Äôt read the popup box and the helpful tooltips that pop up on every item (but you always get players like that). All the information is there on screen when and where you need it.

Farming is limited (so far) 1 plant creates >1 resources which balances out why you only have one of each type (early on at least), but with use of magic you can harvest each plant multiple times in a day too. So farming is there and is a thing to do but it's not intended to be an in-game days worth of activities, which I personally like as it then forces you to do a couple of other things in your day too. 
What you farm or scavenge is used to make craftables in a pretty standard way. It‚Äôs still interesting and gives a personal goal and activity. Crafting potions from the products you grew gives you access to spells/magic which is a fun way of connecting the two things together (farming elements and witch elements) and is a fun incentive for farming more things.

Visually its a very cute game with a fin art style that goes in hand with the genre. A wholesome enjoyable game but entirely not up to everyone's standards and taste. (Animation is a bit basic and visuals are nothing to be wowed by but they still have their own charm).

Exploration (again early days, still not unlocked flying mechanic yet/broom or explored the whole map yet) can seem a bit limited, there are a number of invisible walls around but realistically all of them are literally in places that stop you from dropping off the map or getting stuck in a section you‚Äôre not able to get out of like a cluster of rocks due to the lack of jump (which takes away nothing from the game). 

The story seems to be interesting enough so far and adds worldbuilding and character development, which progresses the exploration and player development at a good pace.


Overall its a cute carefree game that has a few flaws but nothing to stop you having a lot of fun exploring, crafting and farming in a very cute art style on a little section of the world to yourself (and your cat).",1

[I]On the Peril of Parrots[/i] is an absolute gem of a game that I can't recommend enough. The puzzles are fun and engaging, with multiple solutions to each one, so you can really flex your problem-solving muscles. And if you make a mistake? No worries, the forgiving gameplay means you won't be punished too harshly. There's an undo button and even a skip button.

But don't think the game is too easy! Each puzzle brings varying levels of challenge, so you'll always be kept on your toes. And with various mechanics to keep things fresh, you'll never get bored. Plus, the interesting narrative about you being AI will keep you hooked throughout the game.

And let's talk about the art and character design. It's dope! I really like the overall visual style of the game. Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. It's so slick (this OST is a MUST), and the perfect accompaniment to your puzzle-solving AI adventure.

The game's visuals are incredibly vibrant and colorful, reminding me of Ori and the Blind Forest. The combat mechanics are reminiscent of Sekiro in that they rely heavily on parrying and timing, which adds a rhythmic element to the battles.

One of the things I loved about Strayed Lights was its beautiful and moving soundtrack, composed by Austin Wintory. The music fits perfectly with the game's visuals and adds an extra layer of emotion and depth to the overall experience.

597,137357595,986130,"Here is my details of my second attempt of the first case (this is just the initial one created, but in the 2 times I played, it ended differently)
So I've just found a body, it's been shot a few times, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. I first decide to try and talk to the last person who was dialled before they died. I look up their name and address and head over there, as I'm walking in I was asking if people knew the victim, and i didn't think much of it, but the lady in the stairwell saw him at 1.30am, not long before they died... I get to the apartment, the person called Violet I'm seeking isn't there, and I get shot almost immediately and wound up in the hospital. I decide I'm gonna head in with violence. I go to the gun store to buy myself a rifle (you can only use them as a baton, but it was fun to pretend I went in pistol whipping them). While I was in the gun store, I noticed in the ledger that Violet recently purchased a gun similar of similar calibre to the murder weapon. I head back, kick down the door and arrest the guy inside, still no Violet, but I search everything, payslips, birth certificates, scan for fingerprints etc. 
But as I was leaving, I notice a handwritten note with an unfamiliar name and address on it. I decide to check it out. I enter the new address and it's a crime scene. I go in to another dead body. I do another search, and discover the same fingerprints were at the first victims house and violets house, as well as here. I also discover a note from the first victim warning them. I go buy some handcuffs and return the violets house in the middle of the night now. I kick in the door and there they are, the same woman from the stairwell... Violet. I put them in cuffs and scan their fingerprints, to discover it's a perfect match to the others i found. I also now find a matching weapon in the kitchen, I arrest and report this case as complete.

I strongly recommend this game, and yes it isn't perfect, there are many quality of life improvements I hope to see get made. I haven't felt many of the same feelings since playing OG Deus Ex when I was a kid many years ago. I am very excited to see where this goes in future, hopefully with mod support and the like.",1

599,137357044,986130,"Something that hasn't appealed to me for playing detective/mystery games is that once you solve the case, you can't really solve it again. So I've never really played one fully myself, usually just watching a playthrough to just be able to listen to the mystery in my off time. And then this game came along and solved that problem for me with a very immersive game that was fun to sleuth and sneak around in and I've just been addicted. While the mysteries might not be as in-depth as a typical mystery game, that feeling of being left to your own devices as you have to put all the pieces together by yourself and being able to do it over and over again is truly addictive.

And to give you an idea of that, I was doing a side job to take a photo of a target based on a physical description. So I went around, asking if anyone recognized that sort of person which led me to a two different apartments and that she was at a restaurant at a certain time monday. I pose as a health inspector to get into their security logs, but they didn't go back far enough for me to be able to find it. So with that lead going cold, I check some of the nearby buildings next to the two apartments she's been spotted at. I eventually manage to find one of her friends working at a fast food joint, who tells me her name and a bunch of other personal info and even that she was recently at the restaurant as well heading west. I look up her name in the phone book and find her address. Then I quite simply knock on the door and get into position to snap a photo. After I got the photo, I drop it off literally to the room opposite her's and I knock on the door to see what just looks like a nerd who was too shy to say hi to a pretty girl.

While it can be simple without as much depth to the murders themselves (at least motive wise behind them at times), the fact this is even possible for a detective game in early access is amazing! I'm very giddy to see what the developer has in store next and if you've been interested in giving mystery/detective games a try, this would be the one.",1

 I snuck into a victim‚Äôs workplace and found emails between him and a co-worker about someone wanting to kill him, 
go to the co-worker‚Äôs place and find that she‚Äôs dead too and the same fingerprints in the victim‚Äôs apartment are now also in the co-worker‚Äôs apartment. 
Found out the last name of the woman who was mentioned in the emails through the city hall government database that I hacked to get personal records on  where she lives. 
Her husband won‚Äôt let me in or ask questions, I sneak through the air vents near the apartment and dropped into her bedroom while she‚Äôs going to bed
Attempted to handcuff her to interrogate her but her husband opened the door and I had to fistfight the two of them
They run away and pull the alarm to alert security and the neighbors just see me beating a random couple in thier underwear with my fists so one of them pulls out a gun and shoots at me
I‚Äôm running away and have a bulletproof vest I stole from the private security office but I‚Äôm bleeding and my leg broke. 
I made it to my apartment building only to pass out due to blood loss and bullet wounds

Things I like:

Music
Multiple art styles working together
UI
Thoughtfulness behind the quality of life features
Creative creature and character designs
Open-world style complements the game genre very well
The full gamepad support is much appreciated
Difficulty is just right
Character customization is great
Small features that show the developers care (eg. creatures changing colors with types)


Things I'd like to see added / improved:

Often, the camera is choppy when walking / running in overworld (playing in 2k on a 21:9 monitor)
Sharper graphics options for those with stronger / weaker setups (shadows specifically are pretty blurry)
Difficulty slider would be good to have in the future, maybe?
Physics are super broken, 3D objects like barrels and rocks only work part of the time
Online play! Let me battle my friends! I sure hope this is planned in some way.
If online is added, a co-op mode would be fantastic, instead of controlling an NPC partner (I understand it would play different from the regular game, but I still think it's a good idea)

That's my current 7-hour review. Maybe I'll update or leave another one in a few days.

had to fight them in narrow and always changing dungeon, no place to doge, and if you use space skill. most of time result in fall of the cliff

1. fall of the cliff 2.creep appear without notice 3.tons of AOE is preparing , no place to hide 4. get stuned in crowd got a easy death. 5.some boss can kill you by one shot.

636,137359476,986130,"Shadows of Doubt is weird.

The first case (that was proc-gen'd) i did was pretty enthralling. But it's kinda cuz i'm dumb and didnt check the city directory thoroughly enough to find the name that matched the jumbled up clue. Because, as it turned out, the killer lived on the same floor as two of the three victims.

The reason i didn't think of this is because it would be very, exceedingly stupid to murder two of your neighbours. But that's how it happened.

So i made a couple new worlds, but the issues i had with the first one continued. On my most recent world, the first murder was done by their next door neighbour, and i found this out because the fingerprints at the crime scene matched up with the fingerprints on the neighbours door. next murder was in broad daylight by the place the victim worked at and had a business card nearby with prints on it. I ran to their workplace, took the prints off of the receptionists desk and immediately matched them with the crime scene.

The third case, and this is where I started to realise the problems fully, was a murder clearly motivated by romantic obsession. and the murderer wrote their first name on the wall. so i looked at the address book, found the name, and went NEXT DOOR and arrested them.

Is it just my worlds? luck? The game isn't particularly good at hiding who did the crimes which it probably should be given the murder mystery thing. if there's a business card clue, it's probably a coworker. if it's not clear by the method of the murder, don't worry the suspect has written their name down somewhere. And if all else fails, literally just check next door, not even on a different floor.

The jobs tend to have a little more variety and detective work because they let you have way less information. You have like, height, hair and the building they live in and you go off of that. And it's way more interesting but even that can get tedious.

I'm not trying to dog on the game that much, it's early access and the developer is obviously committed to improving and completing the game. But in its state right now I think it'd be wiser to maybe wait a bit before pulling the trigger on this  purchase.",0

640,137358405,986130,"[h1] Fantastic, but Brimming with Bugs [/h1]

Ok, first off, I actually love this game, but be aware it is insanely frustrating to play at the moment. There are a few key problems. For one there is simply not enough variety in the game at the moment. Even during my first case in my first play through, logging into multiple PCs quickly showed there is nowhere near enough variation in things you'll see, leaving a major aspect of all building uninteresting to inspect. Secondly, some of the procgen side jobs are INSANELY difficult for terrible pay. Telling you two aspects of what someone looks like and where they live is a hopeless endeavor if the place is more than 3-5 stories tall (the job I had was for a 17 floor building). I even had a friend that was only given the first letter of the name plus looks, leaving her to search the homes of [i] 30 different people. [/i] Only for the game to bug out after the hours of searching and not recognize the very last person as the correct one. 

In my own game, I got the second murder mystery after a few side quests and was pretty excited. There was a bloody cipher on the wall, the body had a calling card next to it demeaning them, and there was no clear evidence that the killer even set foot in the room. However once the second crime scene was called in, there was nothing. No bodies, only a new bloody cipher that was completely illegible due the texture most likely being extremely squished between a wall corner and a window. Who knows, maybe all I needed was in the first room and I could ignore the second one, but man that imminently kill my interest in playing more until this stuff gets patched.

Overall, I do recommend this game. Highly. There's (I think) NOTHING else out there that does detective work in a semi-living world and in such depth, but until the bugs get patched and the procgen mechanism gets more fleshed out with content it can draw from, be aware you're only going to get 4-8 hours in before you star running into repetition and major bugs.",0

642,137359318,909320,"The steam store page of Ruinarch is very telling about how much attention the developers or producers have given to Ruinarch.  All of the screenshots are from early access with no new pictures taken of what the game looks like after release.  Even the trailer is of early access with a dev's testing kit that has unlimited mana and spell casts.  Ruinarch does not play nearly that fast.

Casting five spells at once like in the trailer?  Please, they'll either be five low level spells that everyone resists or two high level spells that devour all our mana to cast.  And that's assuming we get lucky and have more than one mana pit.  If you only get the one guaranteed mana pit, prepare to sit and wait for 30+ seconds between spell casts.  What makes this egregious is that even the afflictions cost mana with a growing mana cost as the spell is upgraded.  I can either cast a cool looking spell or afflict someone with vampirism once per minute.  And the cooldowns of afflictions.  My god, if I wanted to wait 1800 seconds to cast a particular affliction again, I'd...wait, I don't want to do that.

And getting a city of vampires, lycanthropes or cultists?  Ha, good luck.  All it takes is one villager arriving in a migrant wave with the ""Stalker"" job to completely ruin hours of work because they can immediately spot and kill your afflicted villagers regardless of disguise, standing or laws in the village (it can be legal to be a vampire, lycanthrope or cultist if you can influence the village leader).

And that's assuming your cultists, lycanthropes or vampires don't die of other stupid deaths like walking into a monster den and then standing there panicking while monsters tear them apart.  The villager AI in this game leaves a lot to be desired.  I WANT to build a huge cult, but the bastards can't keep themselves alive long enough for me to make progress.

The game does have its good moments though.  Playing as The Ravager and focusing on attacking the villages directly with minions and monsters we've influenced with the monster spawner is fairly entertaining and very rewarding.  And when we do get to cast several spells, the way some of them interact is quite entertaining.

Honestly, Ruinarch is at its most fun for the first 30 minutes of a new map before we've filled the map with hazards for villagers to kill themselves on, when spells are still low level and inexpensive enough to be cast in combos like in the trailer, villager resistances are low and before most of the villagers have died off.  That is when using afflictions and watching the villagers get upset at each other really shines.  After a while, they rarely live long enough for us to get much enjoyment out of watching them, or there are villager classes (like the stalker) that break our favorite toys.  And the victory conditions in Ruinarch are so blas√©.  I usually only do 5 out of the 13 to win before I've already gotten bored with a map and moved on to something else.  

This game has potential, but I don't know if the devs will reach it in a reasonable amount of time.   I'll keep an eye on Ruinarch's updates, because I do manage to find some enjoyment from Ruinarch once in a while and I want to like it.  I don't feel it is worth the current price unless you're just absolutely in love with the idea, and even then I'd say go watch some gameplay videos first.",0

651,137358880,1245560,"This is a wonderful new spin on the farming sim genre. 
The communal approach to gathering ""currency"" and upgrading the tribe/buildings is very refreshing - usually I'm very much a minmaxer, but here it feels like I can just relax and let go of the grind, as things progress naturally and there's not as much pressure to amass as much money as possible. 
The controls are smooth and I love the way the inventory and tools are divided up, makes for a very pleasant gameplay experience. I just wish there was a way to customize key bindings, I hope this is something that will be implemented in future updates. 
I find the minigames for fishing and taming animals quite innovative too, although they do get a bit repetetive at times, but with the game being so relaxed overall I don't mind skipping them entirely for a couple ingame days if I don't feel like it. 
I also like the building system - having preset locations for the buildings gives you just enough freedom without being overwhelmed by choice and wanting to have everything set up perfectly, as is the case with a lot of other farming sim games. 
And finally, the graphics are so pleasant to look at, especially the tilesets/maps feel very organic, and the character portraits are simply beautiful. 
The only issue I currently see with the game is that it might not be as intuitive for players not already familiar with the genre, as the mechanics for e.g. farming or foraging aren't really explained (it took me a while to figure out you could actually shake trees to get pinecones lol)

u play in an explorable city and after a short tutorial mission are on your own when it comes to climb the ladder of social credit to retire from this dystopian world.

there is fair enough depth already and the game does little to no hand holding. Cases can be solved in multiple (!!!) ways and often times leads can turn into dead ends and require you to take a step back and rethink your possibilities. Sometimes it's even worth putting the case on hold and do something else until you literally stumble upon new leads (if the case doesn't resolve because evidence might be destroyed (like a hidden timer but it's all random so you never know).

AI and procedural generation really works well and gets updated and I didn't encounter too much stuff that was broken. Of course this being Early Access you sometimes have to deal with messed up object generation (furniture clipping through vents) but is encountered rarely even at this early stage.

If you enjoy slow paced, detective games where you work using your own flow of actions don't hesitate. This is a pretty solid release with a nice community on discord and several updates down the pipeline. Although the cases usually revolve around the same objectives, case tells its own twisted story and some things you will find in the world even motivate you to start your own investigations from scratch.

Performance-wise, it runs ok.  I'm reading lots of gripes from people with modern PCs, but with a bit of tweaking I've got it running acceptably on a Xeon W3680 with a GeForce 980 GTX.

I've come a across a few bugs.  Most are cosmetic and minor, but I'm currently a bit stuck with a mission I can't finish.  Still, bug report submitted, so hopefully it'll get a fix soon.  At worst, I'll drop the mission and do something else in the meantime.

Mining, mining, mining, mining, mining, mining, mining, mining, Not enough resources to craft stations to make food to save my space man, they die, new character, repeat.

It's really grindy going from planet to planet to find resources to get enough to build the stations to craft items to survive. I took too long to find enough resources to keep my characters well fed, so they starve and die. I still don't have enough resource to make replacement tools so I'm stuck with a broken tool.

The places you visit in space are the exact/similar locations where you're in an asteroid field going out to collect resources, complete the objective before you leave. The experience gets rather repetitive. Sometimes you'll find drones that try to steal your resources, aliens living on rocks, and story events.

The game makes doing things such as putting items into machines a chore to do. instead of selecting how much stuff I want to put in in a simple manner, I have to sit there with my collect gun to slowly put or take supplies. My question is why does it have to be so extra in the process? Building rooms is an extreme chore. as you have to build EVERY SINGLE TILE in the room and it drags the process.

The UI while not terrible is not very friendly, having to equip and unequip your tools so you can access machines.
Not being able to see your stats on screen is annoying so you can plan out your course of action. you have to wait till you start running out of oxygen to go get more oxygen, wait til it gets cold to start returning to the ship to get warm.

Tutorial is bugged on pluto and I can't leave except by exiting the tutorial.

The game kind of plays like Raft in space, but not as engaging.

Positives are, traveling to planets on the ship map is decent...The game looks decent...This game is difficult to recommend in its current state because I find the gameplay dull and repetitive. 

I hope the game gets better, I can see the potential it has if the gameplay was refined and the game isn't so brutal on the survival part.",0

That struggle aside, this is one of the greatest farming sims I have ever played as a long term fan of the genre. I first discovered it as a loose psp game at a thrift shop and absolutely fell in love. The translation is not great (Know spelt as knou in the intro, no spaces after punctuation in many instances) but there is so much heart and warmth in the very simple story the game does have. There is no currency system in the game, the closest being a ""points"" system in the hunting minigame, instead everything is on a barter system that functions as your progression tree as well. There is no town, social systems, or exploration in this game, but that lets it have an extremely meditative focus on your farm which is the screen you spend almost all of the game on.

The real best feature though is that you control the pace of time in this game. Days are static, you can exist in the moment forever if you want, but when you have nothing to do but wait a few days for the crops to come in, you can just button mash a week away instantly. Most farming sims involve heavy time management elements that can be stressful when trying to optimise but Shepherd's Crossing does the opposite by giving control of time over to the player making it a super relaxed cozy game.

( I have finished the game and these are my thoughts ) 

This  Is By Far One of the best Indie Games of 2023 in my opinion

Absurdly good Storytelling and art style especially coming from a small Indie studio that is literally releasing its very first title 

The world of Bramble is really beautifully portrayed with the right mixture of all things, horror , mystery , atmosphere , music everything is completely spot on fits the overall aesthetic like a glove 

The game itself is not very long though, you will require around 5 Hours to complete the game maybe even less if you dont die as much as I do 

The game mechanics for the part is pretty basic until you get to face certain bosses, that is where you see the uniqueness in each of these boss fights, no fight is similar, and there is always something new something surprising waiting for you at the end with a new style of a challenge so the fights dont feel boring at all, the random encounters are full of unique thrill.

I had 0 Bugs and Issues throughout the game 


Rating - 9/10

( Would have given it 10/10 only if it was a bit longer cause I thought it could have had at least a couple more lores and bosses )

I found this to be an incredible experience overall. I was completely captivated from the start until the end. In fact, I couldn't put it down until I finished it around 4 hours later.
With stunning visuals and beautiful audio, the story will take you through a world inspried by Nordic myths, folklore and fairy tales. At times it can be quite light hearted, but like all the great fairy tales, it's never afraid to be brutal, dark and gruesome. 
Your adventure will be sprinkled with horror, platforming, stealth sections, boss fights, puzzles and more. As you continue your journey to the mountain, you'll come to realize the game has a lot in store for you.

Honestly, I can't recommend this game enough.

721,137375341,1860510,"Cool potential, I've had some fun with it in the past, but currently the game is unplayable due to bugs/crashes/freezes. It's a mix between Running With Rifles and Mount and Blade.

My patience ran out after a 30-minute intense battle, where after successfully finishing it, the screen just turned black and there was nothing to do but press ESC. I was able to save the game, but upon loading from the map, the rebels disappeared, and the city I was attacking gained new defenders.

This game needs a lot of improvements before it becomes playable.

The biggest problem is the game freezes, UE errors, and progression-blocking bugs.
The UI is buggy and lacks essential information (e.g., how much food our troops are consuming).
Micro-management (sending resources between settlements) is not enjoyable, and everything is done ""by eye.""
The squad appearance/weapons creator is badly done.
The AI doesn't care about you when you have a pistol, but as soon as you pick up a better weapon, they suddenly become interested in you, and you can get one-shotted by an NPC far away from you.
There's a lack of a battle minimap, information about new squads on the map, and the ability to select multiple (not all) squads using the keyboard. It's difficult to navigate between teams.
The AI is stupid but shoots well.
My AI doesn't seem to want to destroy enemy vehicles, so I often have to take control of someone and deal with it myself.
The anti-aliasing needs improvement. No matter what settings we choose, the game sometimes looks ugly, especially when you try to find an enemy far away from you.
When we aim with a weapon and move the mouse, there's an annoying animation causing the weapon to ""move with delay.""

Paying $27 for a game that is so buggy is a bit overkill, and there is a LOT to improve. Unfortunately, this is one of the less polished Early Access games I've played.",0

If you're willing to manage the jank and low frame rate (which I believe the dev is working on), it's an incredibly interesting and thoughtful detective game, which I hope will turn out to be fantastic with further development.  

I did the tutorial mission and had a lot of issues with the vents teleporting me randomly.  One time I was on my computer in my apartment and got teleported into the vent system in an apartment several floors above me.  Another time I was in the venting system and got teleported outside of the building on top of the venting/outside pipes 12 floors up with no escape other than to jump off and break my legs.  I was interviewing a lady and the person who I suspected was the murderer ran into the apartment and ran around in circles a few times, tried to rob/hold up the lady I was in an interview with and then left while waving a gun around, so that was pretty funny/weird.  I was unable to fully complete the tutorial case due to a bug preventing me from closing the case/archiving it, but it did let me hand it in and said I had gotten everything correct.

The world is incredibly interesting and I love being able to interact with items to find clues and fingerprints.  It's the little details like finding a box in a wardrobe full of files that you can read and take information from, or finding crumpled up notes that further your investigations.

By the time you grab some of the outstanding community content, RW enhancer pro, TS tools plus a real long visit to Armstrong  powerhouse https://www.armstrongpowerhouse.com/  and Alan Thompson https://alanthomsonsim.com/ , and https://www.trainsimcommunity.com/ plus a huge amount of others, and of course Steam workshop, you'll find an amazing amount of content, stuff that really makes Classic Train sim stand out.  Watch for those sales and grab some interesting routes, TS Classic is like iRacing, you don't need to buy everything- just what you want to play, and over a longer period of time. With this in mind I love that classic has so much content, I just bagged the Japanese routes, fantastic I love them. It will be interesting to see the changes in Train Simulator now that Focus owns Dovetail.  I recommend Train Simulator classic, collect stuff over time, tinker with it to get the best from it, accept that the trade off for so much content, and so much free content, the variety, length and depth of scenarios, will be a few bugs, a few crashes, ( I use large address aware and 4gb patch for ALL older games so its much better.) chill out with a beer after work and have some fun. Much preferred in my opinion than watching some of the crap on TV. Whatever you choose to play, go and enjoy it. :)",1

UPSIDES: I really like the tilting physics in this it's fun. I like how trains struggle on uphill grades, very nice. It has a lot of routes. So many of them from around the world! It pretty much have some very interesting trains and locos, lots of diesel, electric, and steam locomotives look decently nice.
DOWNSIDES: The graphics look pretty outdated. Lots of DLC's for this game are pretty expensive but their price is better during sales. Some DLC's can rather be a disappointment as some have bland assets, trains with bland default horns, and quite buggy.",1

773,131489627,24010,"This is by far the worst so called ""simulation"" game ever made. The 1st and biggest problem with this game is the developer, Dovetail games. If you want to play this game with all the expansions then you can expect to pay somewhere in the area of $1,600. 2nd, this game is nowhere close to being a simulation of real railroading. My familys buisness is railroading and this is far from simulation. 3rd, with the constant updates the developer is releasing the updates don't do anything to fix the mountain of errors the game has i.e. half the secnerios on career don't work, the game constantly freezes. 4th problem is the graphics, you would think for the money they are charging for the game and expansions they would have better graphics,b but their graphics quality is about equal to a Nintendo 64.

By now, it's outdated and has been replaced by Train Sim World 2, which has much more detailed panels, much better graphics and sound and arguably more immersion - but far less content. This is like FSX compared to MS FS 2020 but it does have more content.

Honestly I'd like to see the incorporation of the rest of the WM diesel roster such as the Baldwin switchers and ALCo, the RS2's and RS3's as well as the signature chop nose GP9's that were home built by the Western Maryland. I'd actually like to have the whole Western Maryland route in the game, but I digress. The game has a few problems such as the spawning of the GP30's. Spawning the GP30 results in nothing.

There are fewer world building assets than Trainz, but all included model assets are typically higher quality than Trainz, and there are more route choices worldwide. The driving simulation is also much better in Train Simulator 2021 than any version of Trainz. Once TSW2 (or 3?) includes route building, it may surpass Train Simulator at that point.",1

Soon as I loaded up the page I tabbed out to stop a video from auto-playing in the background. and realized that I could no longer click on anything. It was as if I computer froze but I could still see and hear everything going on, I just couldn't interact with anything. As soon as I clicked my mouse whatever program I was running would grey out as If I'd clicked off of it without anything happening. Which was a bit of an issue cause it meant I couldn't click on the notification that had popped up telling me something had gone wrong (A notification to end the application) as when I clicked on it it would grey out, it would still be there and I could see my mouse over it, but it would be greyed out until I tabbed back into it. Also couldn't task manager the problem away as I couldn't click anything. Took me a solid five minutes to realize instead of using my mouse I could just tab into the error message and press enter to end the dialogue. Sadly I was too incompetent to remember to save that error message for reference.

Now that the game had stopped running, I started it up again tabbed out to the steam page to check out if anyone had similar issues before, and quickly realised I could not tab back into the game. And when I closed out of the program from the desktop the background sounds of the train kept going, Despite the fact that my computer no longer recognizes the program as running, according to Steam (and my headset) it still is.

that being said if you are a huge train nerd (like me) and want a good rail-based experience on your pc then this is a pretty great game for that. in particular, the british railway network has a HUGE amount of representation in this game and it's very much catered towards enthusiasts. yes, the game can be a broken mess. yes, the quality of the content can vary wildly but theres so much support for this game, even outside of steam, and there are many third party developers who produce high quality content for this game. even DTG gets it right sometimes. and honestly, i have to say this is definitely one of the better train sims out there.

i probably wouldn't recommend this to someone who just wants to drive a train for the heck of it and isnt really all that interested in them. but if you're passionate about trains, especially if your country's railway network is strongly represented, then i cant recommend this enough",1

Therefore I rely on the ribbon to let me know what speed my train should be going at. But once again the ribbon hasn't been play tested for this. Its really annoying to be 40 - 50 minutes into a route only to find that you're over the speed limit when the limit is posted 500m down the track and you are already decelerating. Its plagued this game for years. The Fife circle line seems OK but the others are all over the place with the limits. In the real world its easy to see a speed sign up ahead, on a pc monitor it flashes by in a split second. It isn't difficult to get the ribbon running right and I can't understand why Dovetail haven't managed to do it for years on so many lines.

If this was just tested a bit before release this would be a much more accessible game for many people.

Also, all the lines now have operable scenarios since engines have been added  to  run them. The whole rail world seems to have been reworked and I find driving these scenarios to be better than earlier versions of the game. Yes, there are ""errors"" here and there but the experience is more realistic and the game flow is smoother. I really would recommend this game to other.

Just a terribly buggy, poorly coded game that they ""update"" each year simply by changing the number on it.  Their other train game, Train Sim World, while not free of performance issues, runs on Unreal 4 and is a much better game though it does last the variety of TS2020.  I would avoid.

UPDATE:  Aftering spending more time with the sim, I can say that the performance (minus the loading stutters) and visuals can be dragged back from the brink by the fantastic modding community.  A reshade, RWEnhancer, and a weather upgrade pack and the visuals are much better.  If you're willing to dabble with third party payware and mods, it becomes a recommended sim.",1

890,65876579,24010,nice,1
891,65868489,24010,"After all these years this is still an outstanding simulator. Graphics might be dated to some, but it's been improved upon with a 64-bit version with developers and third-party folks in the Workshop who are keeping things fresh and creative. Reminds me of the other brethren, FSX. Still fun after all these years.

Game has a very large DLC section with regions from all over the world to cater to every railfan's dream. And you simply aren't just limited to static scenarios or simply driving from one point to another. There are industries to interact with, AI trains to contend with, plus there's even a Free Roam mode which gives a nice Open World feel to the game. On the biggest routes, it's literally an Open World rail simulator. There's also Career scenarios that can unlock further progression through a career-like adventure on a route or train type which can be fun and help with learning everything along the way too.

Speaking of learning, the game has a very good tutorial disguised as a railroad academy for you to play through, learn as you progress with some on-the-job training thrown in.

I did initially have some setbacks with the game, missing files that got sorted out  Also had trouble with the online store that is separate from Steam, which is also attached the the Live community stuff. Devs have gotten all of that sorted out too so I'm very happy now. Highly recommend this game if you're looking for some chill gameplay or are interested in trains or simply just want to play something different. This is a nice change of pace from the high intensity games out there with their toxic communities. Lots of good people I've run into playing this so far. Can't beat that.",1
892,62990426,24010,"So I bought this on Humble Bundle and I liked it enough to search for a discount code for Train Sim World 2020 as well.  So, obviously I really enjoy it.  And I purchased additional DLC for this (hint: dovetail games has a weekly sale on their website, where they seem to offer 5 different dlc every week)  The weekly sales are here -> https://store.dovetailgames.com/us/sale

My thoughts after 20 hours or so:  It is good for what it is.  The graphics can seem a bit dated in 2020.  However, it still looks good enough and some of the DLC looks really good.  If you have to have awesome looking graphics, then maybe take a look at tsw2020.  

I think of it as a train set that does not take up space in my house and does not have the cost associated with a physical set.  If you use it like this you will really enjoy it.  It is quite relaxing and I have been spending a lot of my free time driving trains all over the world.

There are some weird bugs sometimes, but I personally have not run. Into very many, for the most part the trains and routes work well.   The one other downside is the tutorials do not explain everything in detail.  However,  on the steam page for each route or train there is a link to view the manual (not every single dlc has a manual, but most do, and the ones that dont are usually in a route manual or is covered in a different train manual).    The manuals contain the information on signals and all the procedures for starting the trains and the keyboard/gamepad mappings.  So all the information is out there, but I had to do a few searches to find out where to get the manuals.

All in all,  if you think it is something you might enjoy and you can get with a bunch of doc on humble bundle for 12.00 then definitely go for it.   If you are not sure, then spend a $1.00 (You still get a LOT).

  I have over 450 games in my steam library, these train sims have grabbed my interested more than any of the other games I own.",1

Not really a train enthusiast but I like simulation games and driving things around. Had some fun on this game.
Overpriced DLC's, the optimization in this game is... non-existant, my game runs like dogsh*t, I didn't encounter that many bugs but the FPS.. Man..
I guess wait for a sale, paying the full price for it isn't the best choice considering optimization, bugs, etc.

Update 8 October 2021, 471 hours of playtime
So uhhh... I've played this quite a bit since then ^^' 
Yeah, the content from the devs is pretty meh, especially the french DLC's which are pretty disappointing... Thankfully, the community mods are what make this game worth buying, there's endless content, both free and paid, from the community that's way better quality than the dev's content.
The way the devs handle this game is pretty pathetic but you can always count on the community to do their best.
I'm now a full on train enthusiast and have acquired wayyyy more knowledge which makes this game even more enjoyable (except when the devs make a disappointing update which happens a lot)",1

DoucheBag Gamer.",1
923,54177432,24010,"I am really torn about what to say about this game.
To be honest, I am not overly interested in trains and see them merely as a way to get form A to B. However, I was won over by the attention to detail in the scenery and wanted to give it a go.
Overall, I am doing much better than I thought I would; mostly, for me, though, it is enjoying looking at the scenery that makes it an interesting game. Based on this alone, I would give it a thumbs up.
However, there are two glaring problems I am facing; one of these issues I will guess is down to my lack of knowledge regarding trains; the other definitely is not.
Firstly, I seem to be having issues with speeding despite scrupulous attention to the limits - even to the point of being a bit overly-cautious. My issue is when a speed limit is imposed without it showing on my information overview in front of me. For example, I was moving down from 100 KPH to 60 KPH which was the next indicated speed limit. I was well within limits and was going to comfortably be below 60 KPH by the time the limit became valid. Then, without any notice, or any indication, the limit changes to 50 KPH. This means I am now speeding but there has been no indication on the tracking information at all that this limit was going to come into effect. I am probably missing something but, I have to say, I feel a bit cheated.
The second problem is what has convinced me to give this a thumbs down - the doors. When stopping at a station, I let the passengers depart and alight and physically watch the doors as they close before commencing the journey. More than once I have then failed the game because I have started to move with the doors open! I mean, I saw the doors close so how can this be?
Very frustrating when I was halfway through an hour-long game only to have it ended by what I can only assume is a bug.
Frustrating, as this could be a nice way to pass an hour or so if not for these irritating problems.
If anyone can suggest what I am doing wrong that would be a big help and might change my overall judgment.",0

934,34111501,24010,"I must say I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews. Yes the platform (no pun intended) is rather long in the tooth and can be prone to bugs if you don't know how to avoid them and the fps issue can sometimes irritate. But as someone who built a model railway as a kid, this is the next best thing. 

The base game will provide a few routes and there's a lot of DLC but no-one is forcing you to buy it. Creation of DLC is time-consuming and for that I certainly don't think it's overpriced. Better still, most of it is reduced in sales at various windows through the year.  Create a wishlist and you'll be informed if any items are reduced. 

I find it quite thereputic driving around Europe and testing myself, I usually stick some music on too, it's certainly more entertaining than most of the rubbish on TV and people seem happy to pay ¬£80 a month for that.

There is a lot more scenery available than for the other TSW2 title, and it's a better sim experience in general. I use TrackIR and like that it is fully supported in the game.

961,137380455,986130,"The game is great. It's very satisfying to to be working on a side job, have dispatch announce a murder over the radio, drop everything because why would I want to be taking a photograph of someone when I could be solving a murder, then go through my own personal process of finding the culprit and how they did it.

The game is not free of issues. Since launch, I've run into several bugs, some fixed, some still active as of this review. However, overall, the game feels good to play. The base systems all work well with the majority of bugs I've found feel like they come from the side tasks. An example of this would be having a mission that requires me to steal a secret envelope then placing it near an object at a location just for that location to not having any object of that type.

One glaring issue that I saw and have seen from other reviews is some side jobs will just give you the least information possible. I was tasked with stealing a secret envelope from an apartment. All I was given was the building (not the room #) and a fingerprint. All I could do was go door by door of this 13 floor building, which has about 4 or so apartments per floor, scanning fingerprints on the front doors because people hate me and refuse to give me their fingerprints when asked. Now, if this was suppose to be a very difficult side job then I'd perhaps let it slide but I'd at least complain that with difficulty, it should be more interesting as well. At best, this was a time sink that didn't feel rewarding enough as it was a very early job that gave me like $900

Despite all of this, the game nails the atmosphere and feeling of being a PI. It absolutely scratches the itch of wanting to solve a crime by putting all the pieces together. I haven't progressed too far into the game so the side jobs and murders haven't been too large in terms of steps and leads you have to check to get the full picture but so far it's been great. I was having a great time but then I had to unscramble a bunch of letters to form the name of the killer. If that's happening early on then I can't wait to see what happens further into the game and in future patches.

I am BEGGING for some way to create our own mysteries. I need this.",1
962,137380201,506480,"Reviewed at patch 0.0.4, April 27th, 2023.

Let‚Äôs rewind back in time a bit. Imagine starting your first D&D campaign as a kid, full of enthusiasm, having read some books you managed to procure after months of saving. Absorbing the fantasy in it, flipping giddy through the impeccably fresh pages of the 1st edition Players Handbook by Gary Gygax, your expectations and imagination are running amok in your frenzied brain. And then your dungeon master rips out half of the pages because he‚Äôs not using all the mechanics, never prepares for sessions, wings everything poorly as you go along, pausing awkwardly when he can‚Äôt quickly think of how to progress, and spills soda on what‚Äôs left of your new book. You also don‚Äôt have enough dice, somehow missing a d20, so you roll everything with a d12, which the DM even manages to toss out a window in a freak sandwich accident.

Over-exaggerated? Perhaps, but it‚Äôs what Archmage Rises feels like in this very early incarnation. So early even the rooster is annoyed at being woken up. In my playtime, I‚Äôve encountered more bugs, errors, and glitches than all the D&D books on offer combined, official and fan made. Sometimes it works wonderfully, and then it starts selling its soul to the denizens of the Nine Hells.

Just a few examples, so you get the idea of the current chaos of Limbo behind it. I got soft locked in the inn menu dialogue multiple times, with none of the responses doing anything, the only solution being quitting to the main menu. The inn service menu also changed to a shop one a few times when I clicked on rest or gambling options, and I‚Äôve had town building lists randomly multiply like splitting Ochre Jellies.

A murder of crows amount of UI bugs is still present, pictures are missing, including your character‚Äôs, there‚Äôs a complete lack of any kind of tooltips and information for many things, and it‚Äôs still generally missing even basic QoL polish. To top it all off, my saves got corrupted twice, both times when I tried leaving town after a few hours of play, and only got a black map without the ability to do anything, forcing me to reload saves which, to my dismay, got raided by the orcs of Obould Many-Arrows, and didn‚Äôt work anymore.

The idea of an entire randomly generated, living and moving fantasy world, with history, names, places, characters, and your destiny in it, which you can roleplay and shape with your actions sounds wonderful on paper. It‚Äôs not Dwarf Fortress, but I‚Äôm guessing it might be planning on it. What you get now is a sort of a bland Settlers of Catan look-alike map, where you move in hexes, with not much gusto behind it, every map looking the same. NPC characters are plentiful, but the relationship, dialogue, and quest options behind them are in short supply, making them look like paper dolls instead of NPCs.

Combat has received an overhaul before the EA release. It‚Äôs turn based using action points, and works on a grid, but with you petrified in place like a gargoyle on overwatch, unable to move. Enemies do have functional appendages for walking, and will move around, especially if they have any range on you. Occasional cover on the battlefield which you must break, while ranged enemies ignore them like Legolas, makes for some slightly tedious encounters. Some of them also block direct target spells, like barrels for example. Better melee weapons and bows, which require a higher weapon skill are sometimes more useful than any spell in your grimoire.

A stamina system that‚Äôs in place for many out of combat actions drags the game down. I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre going for as much realism as possible, but the way you spend it, and the amount you have reminds me of the worst survival game mechanics where you need to eat two cows a day, or a truckload of blueberries, to not starve. Also, it takes about two moon phases to harvest a single berry or chop a piece of wood, so you‚Äôll probably starve anyway.

Dice rolling suspiciously seems to behave like it borrowed a manual from XCOM, and added some weighted dice of its own. Critical fails are particularly abysmally brutal, breaking your arms, legs, popping eyes, and sloshing brains like a poorly packed barrel of ale. An epitaph example, ‚ÄúA one he rolled on explore, +7 modifier to a skill roll critically failed, pristine meadow dandelion inhaled, died did he of brain hemorrhage‚Äù.

Game dungeons work like old school dungeon crawlers, and you move room by room, with the added 180 degrees mouse look. They‚Äôre probably the only place where I haven‚Äôt encountered any bugs. As with all the other game elements, they‚Äôre mostly empty, feel packed with asset flips, with only a few loot containers if you‚Äôre lucky, traps that will surprise you if you‚Äôre unlucky, and some enemies. There‚Äôs a lot of rooms marked on your map, like kitchens, shrines, and libraries, but without any purpose.

Spellcasting is the main draw of the game, making you feel the progress, power, and epicness of the greatest mages of fantasy history. Well, in theory, at least for now. It also received an overhaul before the EA release, and works on a system the devs call Ara. It used to work with stamina, which made the already mentioned stamina issues even worse. Most spells also seem to have been downgraded a lot from the demo version I had access to before release.

Using spells of a particular school gets you experience points tied to that school, and you can spend them on new spells, or increase the power of a particular school. It kind of seems like magic should be more special, have more punch, flair, panache, whatever we‚Äôll call it, but for now, it seems to be just a way of attacking, and finds little use outside of combat except for further draining your stamina.

Your character is fully equippable with different items, and there‚Äôs plenty of them, from weapons, and armors to utility items needed for harvesting and collecting ingredients. Lots of skills are available as well, all of them trainable by using them. The economy is superficial at the moment, it‚Äôs coming in the future, as the first upgrade, even though tradable goods of all kinds are here. 

It‚Äôs impossible to describe the projected scope of this game in one Steam review, with many of the design decisions not feeling great right now, and almost none of the larger systems present, I touched on just some things available at the moment. I‚Äôve seen tower building, and one of the main quests in the demo version, but EA release gets dull and repetitive quickly. Feel free to take a look at the projected roadmap, there‚Äôs a link at the beginning of the EA box. And it‚Äôs ambitious, the Great Wheel of Planescape humongous, with some questionable DLC decisions locking important and integral parts of the entire living world shtick behind a paywall. The current asking price for a barebones access with another EA catch-all roadmap also feels too high. The game should possibly be fully playable without hard locks if you plan on charging people that much.

If you‚Äôre itching for or have ever dreamed of a solo D&D campaign in a fully living world, to live a complete life of an aspiring mage and wield earth shattering spells, or die from awkwardly falling down a mountain, this might be the game for you. Sadly, with a lot of caveats, as has been evidenced numerous times. If you‚Äôre willing to trust them, imagine the devs here as your dungeon master, creating the world and the game through early access for you. It could turn out a total fiasco with ripped and smeared pages, or it could turn out the next Legend of Vox Machina.

It didn't bother me as a kid, but the story is so dumb it's funny - Remember kids fasten your seatbelts, otherwise you're going to awake an entire hellspawn.

As a connoisseur of Kangurek Kao games, I am convinced that the first installment of this series is by no means for babies. The clumsiness of camera controls and movement, lack of clues, terrifying monsters that cannot be eliminated permanently (unless we use a flying glove) and the agony cry of a kangaroo when it falls endlessly freezes the blood. The challenge itself is to complete the game, not to mention finding all the hidden rooms, bonus levels and all the ducats. The only facilitation here is the ability to put on a gauntlet with a flag marking a new respawn point, unfortunately, these are also limited.
That being said, I am convinced that you should play this game. The music is perfectly matched to each level, it is original and enjoyable. There will also be well-known classics (for example, a remix of the song ""Drunken Sailor"" in one of the sea levels). Personally, I love the space level tracks, they're kind of synthwave. The levels themselves are colorful and pleasing to the eye, but beware of levels where the camera is set to the side - playing with a keyboard is a Torment 13. The story itself is a pantomime, which is a universal way of telling it, regardless of nationality, culture or age of the player.
To sum up - the game has grown old, but it effectively and pleasantly kills time for a few hours.

TL;DR
Cool but difficult.

1002,137378370,1861630,"""Junk Survivor"" couldn't have a more fitting name.  It's pretty assets from the Unreal Marketplace and looks good in the video and screenshots sure, but it's nothing but yet another lazily cobbled together pile of asset JUNK.

https://youtu.be/6yKfajwPB78

If this games graphics and art style look familiar, that's because it ""is"" familiar.  The UI and crafting system is from the ""Easy RPG survival"" asset kit on the Unreal Marketplace, and the zombies and world are comprised of the all too popular Polygon apocalypse asset packs.  This asset cobbling developer, like so many now on Steam who want to call themselves ""developers"" really only know how to cobble together assets and hit the export button.  Both kits used in this JUNK have been used in well over 200 asset trash zombies games on Steam already.  This is nothing new and that's why it looks so familiar.  (Check out my video review on Youtube of ""Iron Survival"" for one such example of these same kits mashed together and this was more than two year ago now)


Avoid this at all costs is my recommendation and put your hard earned money into one of the many survival games here on Steam that have actual ""effort"" put into them by developers who actually know how to code and not just cobble together asset packs into a big in-cohesive mess.",0
